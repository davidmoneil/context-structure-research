# Knowledge Base

This directory contains a knowledge base of files in the `data/` folder.

A summary index is available at `summaries.md` in this directory.
Use Grep or Read on `summaries.md` to find relevant files by topic,
then Read those data files to answer questions.

Do NOT try to load the entire summaries file into context.
Instead, use targeted Grep searches on summaries.md to find the files you need.
