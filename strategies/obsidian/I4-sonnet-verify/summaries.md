| `data/05-AI/Research/2026.01.20-YouTube-Transcript-UnsupervisedLearning-PAIv2.md` | Daniel Miessler (security consultant, Unsupervised Learning newsletter) presents to host Clint his "Kai" AI augmentation system—built on Claude Code with ~65 custom skills, a deterministic code-before-prompts philosophy, self-upgrading capability via an upgrade skill that monitors Anthropic releases and YouTube channels, a custom history system, and a multi-agent voice system with distinct personalities—demonstrating a live art skill that generates D3/technical diagram visualizations, all at a total monthly cost of approximately $250. |
| `data/05-AI/Research/2026.02.14- Research Project - Context Orchistration/Best Practices Research.md` | A 2026 research document surveying 28+ sources on LLM context orchestration finds that Context Forge's hypothesis—using a small local LLM to preprocess and restructure context for larger models—is well-supported by existing compression research (LLMLingua, RECOMP, CompactPrompt), while its restructuring angle (vs. mere token pruning) represents a genuinely novel contribution, and provides concrete guidance on compression ratios, LLM-as-judge bias mitigation, statistical methodology (paired bootstrap + Wilcoxon), and evaluation pipeline design using Promptfoo and Python. |
| `data/05-AI/Research/2026.02.14- Research Project - Context Orchistration/Combined Research Outline.md` | A combined research outline integrating three streams—empirical context structure testing (849 tests showing flat organization wins), operational context management (115 files, 97k tokens), and Context Forge (a proposed small-LLM preprocessing layer with 6 strategies)—into a unified 4-phase project aimed at determining how to optimally select, shape, and compress LLM context to maximize output quality while reducing token usage. |
| `data/05-AI/Research/2026.02.14- Research Project - Context Orchistration/Context Orchestration Research Project.md` | "Context Forge" is a research project proposing a local LLM orchestration layer (via Ollama) that preprocesses and compresses context through modular strategies—keyword extraction, distillation, structured reformatting, and semantic caching—before routing to a target model (Claude API or larger local models), with the hypothesis that structured context preparation can improve output quality and reduce token usage for smaller models, evaluated via LLM-as-judge scoring across accuracy, completeness, conciseness, coherence, and faithfulness dimensions. |
| `data/05-AI/Research/2026.02.18-Research-claude-mem-vs-AIProjects-Memory.md` | A 2026-02-18 technical comparison of **claude-mem** (a ~29,420-line TypeScript Claude Code plugin that auto-captures tool usage, semantically compresses it via a secondary Claude subprocess at ~2x API cost, and stores it in SQLite + ChromaDB) versus **AIProjects** (a 12-subsystem infrastructure hub with 205 context files, 42 hooks, and curated human-guided memory), concluding that claude-mem should not be installed but 4 patterns—automated session summaries, progressive disclosure search indexing, structured observation format, and `<private>` privacy tags—should be cherry-picked into AIProjects at an estimated 10–14 hours of effort with zero additional API cost using local Ollama. |
| `data/05-AI/Research/Building a lightweight self-hosted API integration hub.md` | A technical analysis comparing lightweight OAuth credential management solutions (Windmill, Trigger.dev, Temporal.io) against a DIY approach that extracts Nango's core patterns—YAML provider definitions, AES-256-GCM encryption, and pg-boss job orchestration—into a ~1,000-line TypeScript integration hub, with a decision framework for a home lab environment running n8n, Authentik, and PostgreSQL. |
| `data/05-AI/Research/Open source API integration solutions for TypeScript developers.md` | A technical research document evaluating API integration tools for TypeScript/Node.js developers, recommending Nango (500+ connectors, Elastic 2.0 license) as the primary self-hostable OAuth/credential management platform, Activepieces ($800/month) for embedded iPaaS over n8n ($50,000/year), and oauth4webapi/orval for custom OAuth and client generation, with MCP emerging as the AI-integration standard. |
