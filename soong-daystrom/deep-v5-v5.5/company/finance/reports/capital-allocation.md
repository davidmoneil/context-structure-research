5. **Consistent Shareholder Returns**: Provide predictable dividends while maintaining buyback flexibility

|-----------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------|
| R&D - Core | 15% | 5 years | Must align with product roadmap |
| R&D - Breakthrough | 20% | 8 years | Board approval required |

#### Research and Development

**Target**: 17-19% of revenue annually

| Category | FY 2124 Budget | % of R&D | Focus Areas |
|----------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Product Development | $4.9B | 58% | PCS v4, NIM-6000, IAP 3.0, SCE 4.0 |

### Priority 2: Strategic M&A (10-20% of FCF)

We pursue acquisitions selectively to fill technology gaps, acquire talent, or accelerate entry into adjacent markets. Our M&A discipline requires clear strategic rationale and rigorous financial analysis.

#### M&A Philosophy

**What We Look For**:
- Technology that would take 3+ years to develop internally
- Exceptional talent teams in strategic areas
- Market positions that accelerate our growth
- Capabilities that enhance our competitive moat

**What We Avoid**:
- Large transformational deals that create integration risk
- Companies requiring substantial turnaround
- Markets outside our core competencies
- Transactions that significantly lever the balance sheet

#### M&A Criteria

| Factor | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Strategic Fit | High | Must advance existing segments or create adjacent opportunities |
| Technology Quality | Top quartile | Only acquire differentiated IP |
| Team Retention | >80% at 2 years | Talent is often the primary value |
| Revenue Synergies | Identifiable | Must see path to growth acceleration |
| Cost Synergies | Secondary | Not primary deal driver |
| IRR | >15% (strategic), >20% (tuck-in) | Exceed cost of capital with buffer |
| Leverage Impact | <1.0x incremental | Maintain investment-grade profile |

#### Historical M&A Track Record

| Acquisition | Year | Price | Revenue Synergies | Status |
|-------------|------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| NeuroSync Labs | 2120 | $8.2B | $4.8B achieved | Exceeded expectations |
| Quantum Kinetics | 2119 | $420M | $340M achieved | On track |
| Atlas Robotics | 2117 | $180M | $220M achieved | Exceeded |
| Cognitive Systems | 2116 | $290M | $180M achieved | Below expectations |

**Lessons Learned**:
- Technology-focused acquisitions outperform market-expansion deals
- Founder retention critical for 2+ years post-close
- Integration speed matters; faster is generally better
- Cultural fit is non-negotiable

#### Current M&A Pipeline

**Announced**: Quantum Dynamics Corporation
- Purchase Price: $1.8B cash
- Strategic Rationale: Quantum computing expertise for Prometheus
- Expected Close: Q1 2125 (pending regulatory approval)
- Integration Plan: R&D integration complete within 12 months

**Pipeline Stage**:
| Stage | Number | Total Value Range | Primary Focus Areas |
|-------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Active Discussion | 2 | $200-400M | NIM sensors, AI safety |
| Due Diligence | 1 | $150M | Industrial vision systems |
| Watching | 6 | $50-500M | Various |

#### Annual M&A Budget

| Year | Budget | Deployment Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| FY 2124 | $2.0B | Quantum Dynamics + 1-2 tuck-ins |
| FY 2125 | $1.5B | 2-3 tuck-in acquisitions |
| FY 2126 | $2.5B | Strategic opportunism |

### Priority 3: Shareholder Returns (30-40% of FCF)

We are committed to returning capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.

#### Dividend Policy

**Philosophy**: Provide stable, growing dividend that shareholders can rely on

**Current Dividend**: $0.80 per share annually ($0.20 quarterly)
**Yield**: ~0.24% at current price
**Payout Ratio**: ~13% of earnings

**Dividend Growth Target**: 10-15% annually, aligned with EPS growth

| Year | Annual Dividend | YoY Growth | Payout Ratio |
|------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| FY 2121 | $0.60 | 15% | 19% |
| FY 2122 | $0.68 | 13% | 17% |
| FY 2123 | $0.80 | 18% | 14% |
| FY 2124E | $0.92 | 15% | 13% |
| FY 2125E | $1.04 | 13% | 12% |
| FY 2126E | $1.20 | 15% | 12% |

**Dividend Commitment**:
- Maintain or grow dividend in all but extreme circumstances
- Target payout ratio of 12-15% over time
- Prioritize consistency over yield maximization

#### Share Repurchase Program

**Philosophy**: Opportunistic buybacks that enhance per-share value

**Current Authorization**: $5.0B (approved December 2123)
**Remaining Authorization**: $4.2B
**FY 2124 Target**: $1.5-2.0B

**Execution Principles**:
- Repurchase when shares trade below intrinsic value estimate
- Maintain consistent baseline to offset dilution from equity compensation
- Accelerate during market dislocations
- Never repurchase to meet EPS targets artificially

**Repurchase History**:

| Year | Amount | Shares | Avg Price | Intrinsic Value Est |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| FY 2121 | $0.6B | 3.2M | $187.50 | $240 |
| FY 2122 | $0.8B | 3.4M | $235.29 | $290 |
| FY 2123 | $1.2B | 4.1M | $292.68 | $350 |
| FY 2124E | $1.8B | 5.5M | $327.27 | $380 |

**Buyback Triggers**:

| Valuation Level | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| >30% discount to IV | Aggressive buying |
| 15-30% discount | Consistent baseline |
| Near intrinsic value | Dilution offset only |
| >10% premium | Pause repurchases |
