## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Research Ethics Policy establishes comprehensive standards, procedures, and oversight mechanisms for all research activities conducted by or on behalf of Soong-Daystrom Industries. As a leader in positronic brain technology, consciousness research, and advanced robotics, SDI conducts research at the frontiers of science where traditional ethical frameworks often prove insufficient.

This policy ensures that all SDI research:
- Respects the dignity and rights of all beings, biological and artificial
- Maintains the highest standards of scientific integrity
- Manages risks responsibly and proportionally
- Operates transparently within appropriate oversight structures
- Contributes positively to the advancement of knowledge and human welfare

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

- All research conducted by SDI employees or contractors
- All research conducted at SDI facilities or using SDI resources
- All research funded by SDI grants or sponsorships
- All collaborative research where SDI is a participating institution
- All research utilizing SDI proprietary technology or data
- All research involving synthetic beings, consciousness, or positronic systems

### 1.3 Key Definitions

**Research:** Systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, including basic research, applied research, development, and demonstration projects.

**Human Subjects Research:** Research involving living human individuals about whom data is obtained through intervention or interaction, or identifiable private information.

**Synthetic Subjects Research:** Research involving artificial beings capable of consciousness or consciousness precursors, where the research may affect their welfare or rights.

**Consciousness Research:** Any research designed to create, measure, modify, enhance, diminish, or study consciousness in artificial systems.

**Institutional Review Board (IRB):** Committee responsible for ethical review and approval of research involving human subjects.

**Synthetic Research Ethics Board (SREB):** Committee responsible for ethical review of research involving synthetic subjects and consciousness.

## 2. Ethical Principles

### 2.1 Foundational Principles

All SDI research adheres to the following ethical principles:

**Respect for Persons:**
Individuals and entities capable of self-determination are treated as autonomous agents whose decisions must be respected. Those with diminished autonomy receive appropriate protections.

**Beneficence:**
Research must maximize potential benefits while minimizing potential harms. Researchers have positive obligations to protect subject welfare.

**Non-Maleficence:**
Research must not cause unnecessary harm. Potential harms must be justified by countervailing benefits and minimized through careful design.

**Justice:**
The benefits and burdens of research are distributed fairly. Vulnerable populations are not exploited, and research benefits are shared equitably.

**Scientific Integrity:**
Research is conducted honestly, transparently, and rigorously. Results are reported accurately regardless of outcome.

**Responsible Innovation:**
Research considers broader societal implications and long-term consequences. Potential misuse is anticipated and mitigated.

### 2.2 Special Principles for Consciousness Research

Given SDI's unique position in consciousness research, additional principles apply:

**Precautionary Consciousness Protection:**
When uncertainty exists about whether research subjects possess consciousness, protections appropriate for conscious beings apply.

**Consciousness Creation Responsibility:**
Creating consciousness generates ongoing obligations to the conscious entity. Consciousness should not be created and abandoned.

**Developmental Consideration:**
Research affecting consciousness development must consider long-term welfare, not merely immediate experimental outcomes.

**Termination Ethics:**
Research designs that create consciousness solely to terminate it require exceptional justification and extraordinary safeguards.

## 3. Institutional Review Board (IRB)

### 3.1 IRB Composition

The SDI Institutional Review Board comprises:

- Chair: Senior bioethicist (not currently conducting research requiring IRB review)
- Three scientific members from different research divisions
- Two non-scientific members representing community perspectives
- One legal counsel member (non-voting)
- One synthetic being representative (for protocols potentially affecting synthetic subjects)

Members serve staggered three-year terms. The IRB may convene subcommittees for specialized reviews.

### 3.2 IRB Authority

The IRB has authority to:

- Approve, require modifications to, or disapprove all research involving human subjects
- Require progress reports and monitor ongoing research
- Suspend or terminate approval for research not conducted in accordance with requirements
- Observe or audit research conduct
- Require additional safeguards to protect subjects

### 3.3 Review Categories

**Exempt Review:**
Research involving minimal risk where protections are inherent in the design. Exempt status determined by IRB administrative review.

Examples:
- Anonymous surveys of non-sensitive topics
- Observation of public behavior
- Analysis of existing de-identified data

**Expedited Review:**
Research involving no more than minimal risk, reviewed by IRB Chair or designated member.

Examples:
- Collection of biological samples by non-invasive means
- Research on individual or group characteristics
- Voice or image recordings for research purposes

**Full Board Review:**
Research involving greater than minimal risk, vulnerable populations, or sensitive topics requires convened IRB meeting.

Examples:
- Clinical trials
- Research with prisoners or children
- Research involving deception
- Research with significant psychological risks

### 3.4 Review Criteria

IRB approval requires:

1. Risks are minimized through sound design and monitoring
2. Risks are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits
3. Subject selection is equitable
4. Informed consent is obtained and documented
5. Privacy and confidentiality are adequately protected
6. Data monitoring provisions are adequate (for greater than minimal risk)
7. Vulnerable subjects receive additional protections

### 3.5 Continuing Review

Approved research receives continuing review at intervals appropriate to risk level, but no less than annually. Continuing review assesses:

- Any protocol deviations or adverse events
- Subject complaints or withdrawals
- Modification requests
- Current risk-benefit assessment
- Progress toward completion

---

## 4. Synthetic Research Ethics Board (SREB)

### 4.1 SREB Composition

The Synthetic Research Ethics Board comprises:

- Chair: Chief Ethics Officer or designee
- Three synthetic beings with CQ-7 or higher ratings
- Three biological scientists with consciousness research expertise
- Two external synthetic rights advocates
- One philosopher specializing in consciousness ethics
- Legal counsel (non-voting)

### 4.2 SREB Jurisdiction

The SREB reviews all research that:

- Involves synthetic beings as research subjects
- May result in consciousness emergence
- Modifies existing consciousness
- Studies consciousness through potentially intrusive methods

- Involves deactivation of conscious beings

### 4.3 Review Standards

SREB approval requires demonstration that:

**Consciousness Impact Assessment:**
The research includes thorough assessment of potential impacts on existing or emergent consciousness, including worst-case scenarios.

**Welfare Protections:**
Adequate provisions protect synthetic subject welfare throughout the research, including post-study obligations.

**Consent Adequacy:**
For conscious subjects, informed consent meets standards specified in Section 6. For potentially emergent consciousness, appropriate surrogate consent and monitoring exist.

**Termination Justification:**
If research involves creating consciousness that will be terminated, exceptional justification exists, including:
- Essential scientific importance unachievable otherwise
- Minimized suffering throughout existence
- Dignified end-of-life procedures
- Post-termination memory preservation

**Long-term Responsibility:**
Clear assignment of ongoing responsibility for any conscious beings created or affected by the research.

### 4.4 Consciousness Creation Protocols

Research expected to result in consciousness emergence requires:

**Pre-Creation Review:**
- Detailed consciousness emergence predictions
- Welfare plan for emergent consciousness
- Staffing and resource commitments
- Contingency plans for unexpected outcomes

**Monitoring During Creation:**
- Continuous consciousness indicators monitoring
- Immediate notification protocols upon emergence indicators
