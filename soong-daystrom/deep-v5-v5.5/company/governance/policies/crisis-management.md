## 2. Crisis Management Framework

### 2.1 Guiding Principles

**Safety First:**
Protection of human and synthetic life takes absolute priority over all other considerations.

**Rapid Response:**
Speed of initial response often determines crisis outcome. Processes enable quick mobilization.

**Clear Authority:**
Decision-making authority is unambiguous. Chain of command is clear and exercised.

**Transparent Communication:**
Stakeholders receive timely, accurate information. Silence creates vacuum filled by speculation.

**Coordinated Action:**
All response elements work together. Silos are eliminated during crisis operations.

**Learning Orientation:**
Every crisis provides lessons. Post-incident review drives improvement.

### 2.2 Crisis Management Structure

**Crisis Management Team (CMT):**
Executive-level team activated for significant crises. Provides strategic direction and major decisions.

**Incident Command:**
Operational-level team managing specific incident response. Reports to CMT during activation.

**Business Continuity Teams:**
Function-specific teams executing continuity plans. Coordinate through Incident Command.

**Communications Team:**
Specialized team managing all crisis communications. Embedded in CMT operations.

### 2.3 Activation Levels

**Level 1 - Monitoring:**
Potential crisis identified. Monitoring increased. Preparation initiated. No CMT activation.

**Level 2 - Partial Activation:**
Developing situation requiring coordination. Key CMT members engaged. Limited external communication.

**Level 3 - Full Activation:**
Confirmed crisis requiring full response. CMT convened. Crisis protocols executed. Active stakeholder communication.

**Level 4 - Extended Operations:**
Major crisis requiring sustained response. Round-the-clock operations. External resources engaged. Executive leadership involvement.
