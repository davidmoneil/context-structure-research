## Product Line Performance

### Positronic Companion Series (PCS)

**Q2 2124 Revenue**: $4.8 billion (+14.3% YoY)

**Unit Shipments**:
| Model | Q2 2124 | Q2 2123 | Change |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| PCS-400 | 48,000 | 42,000 | +14.3% |
| PCS-500 | 3,200 | 2,100 | +52.4% |
| PCS-250 | 12,000 | N/A | New |
| **Total** | **63,200** | **44,100** | **+43.3%** |

**Average Selling Price**:

**Commentary**:
The PCS Series delivered strong unit growth driven by the successful launch of PCS-250 "Companion Lite" in March 2124. While blended ASP declined due to product mix shift toward the entry-level product, total revenue increased as unit volumes more than offset price compression. PCS-500 Elite continued to exceed expectations in the ultra-premium segment.

**Key Developments**:
- PCS-250 achieved 12,000 unit sales in first full quarter
- PCS-500 medical certification expanded to 8 additional countries
- Aurora (PCS v4) development on track for Q2 2125 launch
