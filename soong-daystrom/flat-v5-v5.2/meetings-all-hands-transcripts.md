### Opening Remarks - Dr. Maya Chen, CEO

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us from around the world. I'm speaking to you from our San Francisco headquarters, but I know we have colleagues watching from Austin, Singapore, Guadalajara, and our offices in over 14 countries. Whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening where you are, thank you for being here.

Before we dive into results and updates, I want to start with a moment of appreciation. This quarter marked the 32nd anniversary of Soong-Daystrom Industries. Dr. Arik Soong III, our founder and Chairman Emeritus, reminded me recently that when he started this company, the idea of a companion robot that could truly understand human emotions seemed like science fiction.

Look at what we've built together. Four and a half million PCS companions are part of families around the world. Our industrial automation systems run in over 8,000 facilities globally. And our neural interface technology is helping hundreds of thousands of people communicate, heal, and live better lives.

None of this happens without you. Every one of you contributes to our mission of creating technology that enhances human potential. So before anything else, thank you.

### Business Update

Let me share our Q2 results. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter.

Revenue reached $11.8 billion, up 14% compared to the same quarter last year. This exceeded our own expectations and demonstrates the strength of demand for our products.

Let me break this down by segment:

Our Positronic Companion Series continues to lead the market. PCS revenue was $5.3 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The PCS-250 "Companion Lite" that we launched last quarter is exceeding expectations. We're seeing strong adoption among first-time buyers and younger consumers. Importantly, many of these customers are upgrading within their first year to our Pro models - a testament to the quality of the experience we deliver.

Industrial Automation generated $4.2 billion in revenue, up 18%. This is really exciting. Manufacturers worldwide are accelerating their automation investments, and they're choosing SDI because of our AI capabilities. Our IAP platform doesn't just automate - it optimizes. Customers tell us they're seeing 15-20% productivity improvements beyond their initial automation investments, simply from the intelligence our systems provide.

Neural Interface Modules continue their remarkable growth trajectory. NIM revenue hit $1.8 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Healthcare adoption is driving this growth. We now have over 150,000 patients using NIM-100 Medical for rehabilitation, communication assistance, and therapy. I've received letters from family members who can now communicate with loved ones who couldn't speak before. This is why we do what we do.

Our operating margin improved to 17.3%, and we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. This financial strength gives us the resources to continue investing in our future while delivering returns to our shareholders.

### Strategic Project Updates

Now let me update you on some of our most important strategic initiatives.

Project Atlas is making tremendous progress. For those who may not be aware, Atlas is our heavy industrial robot platform designed for the world's toughest jobs - mining, construction, disaster response. I'm thrilled to announce that we've signed our first commercial contract with Rio Tinto. Four Atlas units will begin operations at their Pilbara mining complex in early 2025.

This is a significant milestone. It validates years of research and development. More importantly, it opens a new chapter for SDI - bringing our AI capabilities to environments that are too dangerous or demanding for humans. When I visited the Austin facility last month and watched an Atlas unit navigate a simulated collapsed building while locating and marking survivors, I was reminded of why our work matters.

On Project Prometheus - I know many of you are curious about our advanced consciousness research. I can share that we continue to make progress toward our scientific goals. This work requires patience, rigor, and above all, ethical responsibility. We're not racing to a headline. We're working to understand consciousness in a way that will benefit humanity. I'm proud of the team's discipline and commitment to doing this right.

Regarding Quantum Dynamics - in August we signed the definitive agreement to acquire this leading quantum computing company. This acquisition will accelerate our AI research capabilities significantly. Quantum computing is essential for the next generation of neural architectures. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025. I want to extend a warm welcome to the Quantum Dynamics team who will be joining us.

### People and Culture

Elena Vasquez, our Chief Human Resources Officer, will share more details shortly, but I want to highlight a few things.

Our employee engagement score reached 84% in this year's survey. This is the highest score in company history. In an industry where talent competition is fierce, this tells me we're doing something right.

We've added over 600 new colleagues so far this year. I want to particularly acknowledge our Singapore team, which has grown to nearly 850 employees as we prepare for our new campus opening. The innovation coming from Singapore - particularly in neural interface technology - is remarkable.

I also want to celebrate the promotion of Dr. Yuki Tanaka to Senior Vice President of Advanced Research. Yuki has been instrumental in some of our most important scientific breakthroughs. This promotion recognizes her extraordinary contributions and leadership.

### Looking Forward

As we move into the second half of 2024, I want to share what we're focused on.

First, we're preparing for the next generation of PCS - Project Aurora. While I can't share details yet, I can tell you that what's coming will redefine what people expect from companion technology. The team is doing extraordinary work.

Second, we're accelerating our path to bringing NIM technology to consumers. Imagine being able to control your devices, enhance your focus, or deepen your meditation practice through a comfortable, non-invasive neural interface. This future is closer than you might think.

Third, we're continuing to strengthen our position in industrial automation. The IAP 3.0 platform will be a leap forward in what intelligent manufacturing can achieve.

And throughout all of this, we're maintaining our commitment to ethical AI development. This isn't just about compliance or risk management. It's about who we are as a company. We build technology that helps humanity. That's our north star.

### Closing

Before I turn things over to James, Sarah, and Elena for their updates, I want to leave you with this thought.

Thirty-two years ago, our founder asked a simple question: Can we create technology that truly understands us? Not just processes our commands, but understands our needs, our emotions, our aspirations?

Every day, we get closer to answering that question with a resounding "yes." Every companion robot that helps an elderly person feel less alone, every industrial system that protects workers from dangerous conditions, every neural interface that gives someone their voice back - these are steps on that journey.

You are part of something historic. I'm grateful to work alongside each of you.

Now let me turn things over to James to discuss our technical roadmap.

### Technical Update - Dr. James Okonkwo, CTO

Thank you, Maya, and good morning everyone.

I want to provide an update on our technology development and what you can expect from our R&D organization.

Let me start with our core platform - the Synthetic Consciousness Engine. SCE 4.0 is in advanced development and will power our next generation of products. The improvements are substantial:

First, we've achieved a 40% improvement in processing efficiency. This means our products can do more while consuming less energy. For PCS, this translates to longer battery life. For IAP, it means faster response times and more sophisticated optimization.

Second, we've significantly enhanced our emotional modeling capabilities. SCE 4.0's emotional intelligence approaches human levels in controlled testing. Our products will be more empathetic, more responsive, and more genuinely helpful.

Third, we've integrated advanced safety constraints throughout the architecture. The ATLAS-Safe framework, developed by Dr. Marcus Thompson and his team, ensures our AI systems remain aligned with human values and behave predictably even in novel situations.

I want to call out the teams responsible for these achievements. The Singapore neural architecture team under Dr. Wei Zhang. The safety and alignment team in San Francisco. The integration engineering teams in Austin. And the countless others who contribute daily. Your work is world-class.

On manufacturing technology, we continue to advance our production capabilities. Our Austin facility now operates the most advanced positronic matrix fabrication line in the world. Defect rates have fallen to 0.03%. This is why our products are the most reliable in the industry.

Looking ahead to 2025, you can expect continued investment in our core capabilities. R&D spending will increase to approximately 18% of revenue. We're expanding our research partnerships with leading universities. And we're bringing in the best talent from around the world.

I'm often asked about competition. Here's what I believe: Our sustainable advantage is our people and our culture of innovation. We attract researchers who want to push boundaries and engineers who take pride in quality. As long as we maintain that culture, we'll continue to lead.

Thank you. Let me turn things over to Sarah for the financial update.

### Financial Update - Sarah Park, CFO

Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone.

I'll provide a brief financial overview and discuss what strong results mean for all of us.

As Maya mentioned, Q2 revenue was $11.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Our operating income was $2.0 billion, representing a 17.3% margin. Both figures exceeded our internal targets.

What drives these results? Execution. Every department, every function, every individual contributes. When manufacturing reduces defects, our margins improve. When sales teams win competitive deals, revenue grows. When customer service resolves issues quickly, retention improves. Financial results are the aggregate of thousands of individual contributions.

Let me discuss capital allocation - how we're using our financial resources.

R&D investment continues to be our priority. We'll invest approximately $8.4 billion in research and development this year. This funds everything from fundamental consciousness research to product development to manufacturing technology.

Capital expenditures are focused on capacity and capability. The Austin Line 4 project will enable Atlas production. Singapore campus construction continues. Manufacturing automation investments improve our cost position.

We're also acquiring Quantum Dynamics, as Maya mentioned. This $3.2 billion investment will accelerate our technical capabilities. We're funding this from cash on hand and our existing credit facility. Our balance sheet remains strong with net cash of approximately $4.5 billion.

Finally, we're returning capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. This benefits employees who hold SDI stock through our equity programs.

Speaking of equity - a reminder that our next equity grant for eligible employees will be in November. Please ensure your information in Workday is current.

Our financial health enables us to invest in the future while rewarding our stakeholders today. Thank you for your contributions to these strong results.

Elena?

### People Update - Dr. Elena Vasquez, CHRO

Thank you, Sarah. Hello, everyone.

I always look forward to these meetings because they let me share what's happening with our most important asset - our people.

Let me start with some numbers. We now have 12,634 colleagues worldwide. That's growth of 612 positions year-to-date. We're on track to exceed our hiring plan for the year.

Where is this growth happening? Singapore leads with 147 new hires as we prepare for the campus opening. Austin added 89 positions, primarily in Atlas production preparation. San Francisco added 78, mostly in advanced research.

Our employee engagement score of 84% reflects our culture strength. I want to highlight what employees told us in the survey:

Ninety-one percent of you feel connected to our mission. This is extraordinary. You believe in what we're building.

Eighty-seven percent rate your manager positively. Our investment in leadership development is paying off.

Eighty-six percent feel we encourage innovation. This is who we are.

We also heard areas for improvement. Work-life balance scored 68%. I take this seriously. We've launched new programs including flexible work arrangements, mental health resources, and workload management tools. If you're struggling with balance, please talk to your manager or HR partner.

On development, I'm pleased to announce the AI Talent Academy has now graduated over 2,400 employees. This program ensures everyone, regardless of role, understands the AI technology at the heart of our company. If you haven't participated yet, I encourage you to enroll.

On diversity, we continue to make progress. This year, 38% of new hires are women, up from 34% last year. Underrepresented minorities represent 29% of new hires. We've promoted more diverse candidates to leadership positions than ever before. We're not where we want to be yet, but we're moving in the right direction.

A few announcements:

Open enrollment for benefits begins September 1. Review your options carefully and contact HR with questions.

Our annual performance cycle kicks off in October. Please begin having development conversations with your managers now.

Finally, a reminder about our employee assistance program. It's confidential, it's free, and it's there when you need it. Taking care of yourself enables you to take care of everything else.

Thank you. Maya, back to you for Q&A.

### Q&A Session

**Dr. Chen**: We have time for questions. I can see submissions coming in from around the world. Let me take a few.

**Question 1** (Singapore - Wei from Neural Architecture): Can you share more about how Quantum Dynamics will integrate with our current research?

**Dr. Chen**: Great question, Wei. James, would you like to take this?

**Dr. Okonkwo**: Certainly. Quantum Dynamics brings expertise in quantum processing units and quantum algorithms. Our plan is to maintain their research independence initially while finding integration points. The most immediate application is in neural network optimization - quantum computing can solve certain optimization problems exponentially faster than classical computing. For consciousness research specifically, we believe quantum effects may play a role in neural processing that we haven't fully explored. Their team will help us investigate this.

**Question 2** (Austin - Maria from Manufacturing): How will Atlas production affect our existing manufacturing operations?

**Dr. Chen**: Marcus, as COO, you're best positioned to address this.

**Marcus Williams** (joining briefly): Maria, great question. Atlas production will be entirely on Line 4, which is a new facility within Austin. It won't impact existing PCS or IAP production lines. In fact, we've designed it to share some common infrastructure, so we may see efficiency benefits. No existing positions are affected - we're creating approximately 200 new manufacturing roles for Atlas.

**Question 3** (Guadalajara - Carlos from Quality): What's our strategy for maintaining quality as we grow?

**Dr. Chen**: Carlos, I appreciate this question. Quality is fundamental to our brand.

Our strategy has three elements. First, we invest in automation and technology to reduce human error. Second, we hire and train meticulously - quality starts with people who care. Third, we create a culture where everyone owns quality, not just the quality team.

Our defect rates continue to decline even as we grow. This tells me our approach is working. But we can never be complacent. Quality is something we earn every day.

**Question 4** (San Francisco - Anonymous): Some employees are concerned about AI potentially replacing human jobs. Can you address this?

**Dr. Chen**: This is an important question, and I appreciate the courage to raise it.

Let me be direct: Our mission is to create technology that enhances human potential, not replaces it. Look at our own company - as our AI capabilities have grown, so has our workforce. We've added over 4,000 employees in the past five years.

AI changes the nature of work. It automates repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on creative, strategic, and interpersonal work. Our job is to help our employees adapt and grow.

Specifically at SDI, we're committed to reskilling and internal mobility. If technology changes your role, we'll help you transition to new opportunities. The AI Talent Academy is part of this. Our learning and development programs are part of this.

No technology we build is designed to replace human connection. That's not our vision. That's not who we are.

**Question 5** (Remote - Jennifer from Customer Success): When will we see the next PCS generation?

**Dr. Chen**: [Smiling] Jennifer, you know I can't give you the specific date. What I can tell you is that what's coming will be worth the wait. Our product teams are creating something special. When we're ready to announce, you and the whole customer success team will be among the first to know so you can prepare to delight our customers.

**Dr. Chen**: We have time for one more question.

**Question 6** (Singapore - anonymous): How do you ensure our consciousness research remains ethical?

**Dr. Chen**: This is perhaps the most important question we face as a company.

Let me describe our approach. First, we have multiple layers of ethical oversight. The AI Ethics Advisory Board, which includes external academics and civil society representatives, reviews our research programs. Our internal ethics review committee assesses every project. The Board of Directors receives regular updates.

Second, we've developed frameworks - like ATLAS-Safe - that build ethical constraints directly into our technology. Safety and ethics aren't afterthoughts; they're engineered into our systems.

Third, we proceed carefully. We're not racing anyone. If we need to slow down to get something right, we slow down. No timeline is worth compromising our values.

Finally, we engage with broader society. We publish research, we participate in policy discussions, we fund external AI safety work. These questions are too important for any one company to answer alone.

I'm proud of how our teams approach this responsibility. Thank you for raising it.

**Dr. Chen**: That's all the time we have for questions. Thank you all for joining us today. Keep doing extraordinary work. I'll see you at our next all-hands in November.
