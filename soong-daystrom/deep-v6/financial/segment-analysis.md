## Strategic Recommendations

### Portfolio Prioritization

|---------|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| NIM | **Invest Aggressively** | 125% of proportional | Highest growth, expanding TAM |
| IAP | **Invest for Growth** | 110% of proportional | Strong momentum, Atlas opportunity |
| PCS | **Optimize** | 90% of proportional | Mature, focus on margin |
| SCE | **Selective Investment** | 100% of proportional | Platform importance, SCE 4.0 |

### Resource Reallocation Recommendations

1. **Shift R&D to NIM and IAP**: Reduce PCS R&D by $200M, reallocate to NIM ($150M) and IAP ($50M)
2. **Accelerate Atlas scale-up**: Additional $100M CapEx for manufacturing capacity
3. **SCE 4.0 marketing**: Increase S&M by $50M for launch preparation
4. **PCS-300 decision**: Either reposition or phase out by Q2 2125
