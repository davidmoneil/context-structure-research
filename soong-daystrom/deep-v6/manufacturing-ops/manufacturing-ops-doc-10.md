SAMC handles mechanical assembly and robotics frame fabrication, which benefits from Southeast Asian supply chains and lower labor costs for mechanical work. FNSF specializes in precision neural interface manufacturing, where proximity to European research institutions and specialized electronics suppliers provides competitive advantage. TIC serves as our advanced assembly hub, where integration of complex multi-system products occurs with access to Japanese precision manufacturing expertise.

Dr. James Okonkwo, our Chief Technology Officer, established this geographic distribution strategy in 2121 to optimize quality outcomes while maintaining cost efficiency. His oversight of manufacturing technology integration ensures all facilities maintain state-of-the-art equipment and process standards.
