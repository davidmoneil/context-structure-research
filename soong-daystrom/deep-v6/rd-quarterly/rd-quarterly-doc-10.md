- System overhead: Only 2.1% computational cost

**Commercial Application:** This framework directly enhances the safety profile of the IAP Platform and provides competitive differentiation in regulated industries (healthcare, autonomous vehicles, financial services).

#### Discovery 2: Behavioral Predictability in Adversarial Scenarios

Significant progress was made in predicting AI system behavior under adversarial input conditions. This addresses a critical gap in deployment safety for systems exposed to manipulated or deceptive inputs.

**Research Methodology:**
- Generated 47,000 adversarial test scenarios across 8 domain categories
