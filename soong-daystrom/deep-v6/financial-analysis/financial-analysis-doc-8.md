## Cash Flow Projections (FY2123-FY2125)

### Projected Operating Cash Flow

Our three-year operating cash flow projections incorporate conservative growth assumptions aligned with market analysis and product pipeline maturity.

**Operating Cash Flow Forecast:**

| Fiscal Year | Projected Revenue | Operating Cash Flow | FCF After CapEx | Operating Margin |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| FY2123 | 6,084 | 928 | 486 | 19.1% |
| FY2124 | 6,834 | 1,056 | 521 | 19.8% |
| FY2125 | 7,621 | 1,147 | 612 | 20.4% |
| **3-Year Total** | **—** | **3,131** | **1,619** | **—** |

**Key Operating Assumptions:**

- Revenue CAGR: 12.4% (reflecting PCS-9000 market maturation offset by NIM-7 and IAP Platform expansion)
- Gross Margin: Gradual expansion to 57.8% by FY2125 (driven by higher-margin software mix)
- Working Capital as % Revenue: 12.1% → 11.4% (continued efficiency gains)
- Tax Rate: Effective 18.2% (stable across projection period)

The conservative operating margin expansion of 130 basis points over three years assumes disciplined cost control while sustaining elevated R&D spend supporting Prometheus, Atlas, and Hermes initiatives. We assume no significant pricing increases despite strong competitive positioning, reflecting market dynamics and customer retention priorities.

### Projected Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow, defined as Operating Cash Flow minus Capital Expenditures, represents cash available for debt service, shareholder distributions, and strategic acquisitions.

**Free Cash Flow Trajectory:**

```
FY2123: 928M - 442M CapEx = 486M FCF (52% conversion)
FY2024: 1,056M - 535M CapEx = 521M FCF (49% conversion)  
FY2025: 1,147M - 535M CapEx = 612M FCF (53% conversion)
```

The near-term FCF dip in FY2124 reflects peak capital intensity as Atlas infrastructure deployment concludes and Prometheus safety validation infrastructure reaches operational maturity. By FY2125, we anticipate improved FCF conversion as these major projects transition to maintenance-mode capital requirements.
