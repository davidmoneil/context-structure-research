### Account Concentration Risk Analysis

**Critical Finding:** Top 10 customers represent **38.2%** of total revenue (2122: $267.4M of $700M).

| Concentration Metric | 2122 | 2123E | Risk Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top 10 accounts as % of revenue | 38.2% | 37.4% | HIGH |
| Top 20 accounts as % of revenue | 58.7% | 57.8% | MODERATE-HIGH |
| Top 50 accounts as % of revenue | 79.3% | 78.1% | MODERATE |
| Customer churn rate | 3.2% | Est. 3.8% | MODERATE |
| Average customer lifetime value | $2.3M | $2.7M | Improving |

**Risk Assessment:** Concentration slightly improving as mid-market grows faster (22.3%) than enterprise (8.1%), but top-account dependency remains significant strategic vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
