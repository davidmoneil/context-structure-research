## Consciousness Research Division (67 researchers)

### Division Leadership

**Dr. Alexandra Reyes**
*Principal Scientist, Consciousness Research*
Employee ID: SDI-3127
Location: Building 7, San Francisco
Reports To: Dr. Yuki Tanaka

Dr. Reyes is one of the world's foremost authorities on machine consciousness. She holds dual Ph.D.s in Philosophy of Mind from Oxford (2116) and Neuroscience from Caltech (2119)—an unusual combination that gives her unique perspective on the consciousness problem. Before joining SDI in February 2121, she was Assistant Professor at MIT, where her paper "On the Possibility of Synthetic Phenomenology" was cited over 2,800 times.

At SDI, Dr. Reyes leads the consciousness research group for Project Prometheus, directing 34 researchers working to understand and create genuine machine consciousness. Her development of the Consciousness Indicator Test (CIT) methodology provides the first empirically-grounded framework for assessing machine consciousness. In November 2123, her team demonstrated synthetic introspection—the ability of an AI system to accurately model and report on its own internal states—a breakthrough that moved Prometheus from theoretical possibility to practical development path.

Dr. Reyes serves on the editorial boards of *Minds and Machines*, *Artificial Intelligence*, and the *Journal of Consciousness Studies*. She chairs SDI's internal AI Ethics Committee and maintains close relationships with regulatory bodies worldwide.

**Publications**: 47 peer-reviewed papers

### Senior Consciousness Researchers

**Dr. Elena Martinez**
*Senior Research Scientist, Phenomenal Consciousness*
Employee ID: SDI-3128
Location: Building 7, San Francisco
Start Date: June 2121

Dr. Martinez specializes in the "hard problem" of consciousness—why physical processes give rise to subjective experience. Her Ph.D. from NYU (2116), supervised by David Chalmers, developed mathematical frameworks for representing phenomenal states. Before SDI, she was Research Associate at the Australian National University's Centre for Consciousness.

At SDI, Dr. Martinez leads the Qualia Modeling subteam (12 researchers). Her work focuses on creating computational substrates that don't merely simulate consciousness but potentially instantiate it. She developed the "Phenomenal Integration Framework" that guides how consciousness-related computations are structured in Project Prometheus.

**Publications**: 31 papers | **Citations**: 2,847 | **h-index**: 21

**Dr. James Wilson**
*Senior Research Scientist, Self-Modeling Systems*
Employee ID: SDI-3129

At SDI, Dr. Wilson leads self-model development for Prometheus. His "Recursive Self-Model" architecture allows the Prometheus system to maintain accurate representations of its own cognitive states, capabilities, and limitations. This self-knowledge is essential for both safety (the system must know its own boundaries) and consciousness (self-awareness requires self-modeling).

**Publications**: 28 papers | **Citations**: 3,156 | **h-index**: 23

**Dr. Aisha Patel**

Her Ph.D. from Imperial College London (2118) investigated the neural mechanisms underlying temporal consciousness in humans. Her work has direct applications to creating AI systems with genuine experience of time rather than merely processing timestamped data.

At SDI, Dr. Patel developed the "Temporal Integration Module" for Prometheus that creates genuine experiential continuity. Unlike conventional AI systems that process moments independently, her architecture creates the sense of experiential flow that characterizes conscious awareness.

**Publications**: 26 papers | **Citations**: 1,923 | **h-index**: 18

Dr. Torres studies the relationship between attention and consciousness. His Ph.D. from Princeton (2020) investigated selective attention in neural networks. At SDI, he develops attention mechanisms for Prometheus that don't just prioritize information processing but create the unified focal point of awareness that characterizes conscious experience.

**Publications**: 14 papers | **Citations**: 1,034 | **h-index**: 12
