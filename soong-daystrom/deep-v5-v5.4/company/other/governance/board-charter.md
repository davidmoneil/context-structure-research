### 1.1 Charter Purpose

This Charter establishes the fundamental framework governing the Board of Directors of Soong-Daystrom Industries, Inc. (the "Company" or "SDI"). The Charter delineates the responsibilities, authority, operating procedures, and fiduciary obligations of the Board in fulfilling its paramount duty to guide the Company's strategic direction while protecting the interests of shareholders and stakeholders.

### 1.3 Scope of Authority

The Board possesses full authority to manage and direct the business and affairs of the Company, subject only to the rights reserved to shareholders under Delaware law. The Board may delegate authority to committees, officers, and employees as appropriate, but ultimate responsibility for oversight remains with the Board.
