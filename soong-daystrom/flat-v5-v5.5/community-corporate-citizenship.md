## Message from Leadership

### CEO Statement

Dear Stakeholders,

As Soong-Daystrom Industries advances the frontier of artificial consciousness, we carry a profound responsibility to ensure our technology serves humanity's highest aspirations. This Corporate Citizenship Report documents our commitment to environmental stewardship, community investment, workforce development, and ethical leadership.

The technology we create is not neutral. Companion robots, neural interfaces, and industrial automation systems will reshape society in fundamental ways. We embrace the responsibility that accompanies this transformative power, working every day to ensure that the world improved by our technology is one where all people can flourish.

In 2124, we invested $28 million in community programs, achieved 78% renewable energy usage, and supported 780 students through our STEM Scholars program. We made meaningful progress toward our 2030 sustainability goals while maintaining the strong financial performance that enables continued investment in our mission.

But we also acknowledge areas where more work is needed. Climate goals require faster progress. Workforce diversity has not improved as quickly as we planned. And the ethical questions raised by artificial consciousness grow more pressing with each research milestone we achieve.

This report presents both our achievements and our challenges with honesty and transparency. We welcome your feedback as we continue this essential work.

**Dr. Maya Chen**
Chief Executive Officer

## Environmental Stewardship

### Climate Action

Soong-Daystrom is committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 across our direct operations (Scope 1 and 2). We recognize that climate change poses existential risks to human civilization, and we have a responsibility to lead by example in our industry.

**2124 Emissions Performance**:

| Category | 2123 | 2124 | Change | 2030 Target |
|----------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| Scope 1 (Direct) | 12,400 MT | 11,200 MT | -10% | Net Zero |
| Scope 2 (Electricity) | 36,200 MT | 33,800 MT | -7% | Net Zero |
| Total Scope 1+2 | 48,600 MT | 45,000 MT | -7% | Net Zero |
| Scope 3 (Value Chain) | 284,000 MT | 267,000 MT | -6% | -50% by 2030 |

**Key Climate Initiatives**:

*Renewable Energy Transition*

We have achieved 78% renewable electricity across our global facilities, up from 72% in 2123. Our approach combines on-site generation, power purchase agreements (PPAs), and renewable energy certificates (RECs).

| Facility | Renewable % | Primary Source |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| San Francisco HQ | 100% | On-site solar + PPA |
| Austin Manufacturing | 85% | Wind PPA (Texas) |
| Singapore R&D | 100% | Solar PPA |
| Guadalajara | 62% | Solar + grid |
| Munich Office | 100% | Renewable grid |
| Shanghai | 45% | RECs |

*Energy Efficiency*

We reduced energy intensity by 12% per dollar of revenue through facility upgrades, manufacturing process optimization, and behavioral programs.

Notable projects:
- Austin heat recovery system: $2.4M investment, 18% facility energy reduction
- San Francisco LED retrofit: 34% lighting energy reduction
- Singapore smart building system: 22% HVAC energy reduction

*Science-Based Targets*

Our emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We are on track to meet our interim 2025 target of 45% reduction from our 2020 baseline.

### Water Conservation

Water is an increasingly scarce resource, and our manufacturing processes require careful water management.

**2024 Water Performance**:

| Metric | 2123 | 2024 | Change | 2030 Target |
|--------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| Total withdrawal | 892M liters | 847M liters | -5% | -30% |
| Recycled/reused | 72% | 74% | +2 ppts | 90% |
| Discharge quality | 99.2% compliant | 99.6% compliant | +0.4 ppts | 100% |

**Water Initiatives**:

*Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)*

Our Austin facility achieved ZLD certification in 2123, recycling 100% of process water. We are implementing ZLD at our Guadalajara facility, with completion expected in 2025.

*Water Stress Assessment*

We assess water stress levels at all facilities using WRI Aqueduct tools. Two facilities (Guadalajara, Shanghai) operate in high-water-stress regions, requiring enhanced conservation measures and community engagement.

*Watershed Protection*

SDI participates in watershed protection programs in all communities where we operate, contributing to habitat restoration, streambank stabilization, and water quality monitoring.

### Waste Reduction and Circular Economy

We are committed to eliminating waste from our operations and designing products for circularity.

**2024 Waste Performance**:

| Category | 2123 | 2024 | Change | 2030 Target |
|----------|------|------|--------|-------------|
| Total waste | 8,400 MT | 7,800 MT | -7% | -50% |
| Recycled/composted | 85% | 87% | +2 ppts | 95% |
| Landfill | 15% | 13% | -2 ppts | 5% |
| Hazardous waste | 420 MT | 380 MT | -10% | -75% |

**Circular Economy Initiatives**:

*Product Recyclability*

SDI products are designed for end-of-life recyclability. Current recyclability rates:
- PCS series: 89% recyclable materials
- IAP systems: 92% recyclable materials
- NIM devices: 78% recyclable materials

*Take-Back Program*

Our product take-back program collected 47,000 end-of-life units in 2024, with 94% of materials recovered for recycling or reuse. We provide free shipping and a $200 credit toward new purchases.

*Packaging Reduction*

Product packaging volume reduced by 23% since 2122 through material optimization and elimination of unnecessary components. All packaging materials are now recyclable or compostable.

### Biodiversity and Ecosystems

We recognize our responsibility to protect the natural ecosystems affected by our operations and supply chain.

**Initiatives**:

*Habitat Restoration*

SDI has funded restoration of 2,400 acres of habitat across North America, including wetlands, grasslands, and forests. Projects are selected based on proximity to operations and biodiversity value.

*Pollinator Protection*

Our San Francisco and Austin campuses include certified pollinator habitats totaling 24 acres, supporting native bee populations and other pollinators.

*Supply Chain Deforestation*

We require all suppliers to certify that materials do not contribute to deforestation. Supply chain audits verify compliance, with 98% of suppliers meeting requirements in 2024.
