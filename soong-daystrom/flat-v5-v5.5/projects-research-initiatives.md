**Status**: Active - Year 3 of 5
**Budget**: $89M annually
**Lead**: Dr. Robert Chen

#### Overview

Investigating whether consciousness can exist across multiple physically separated substrates, and if so, what the implications are for identity, continuity, and moral status.

#### Research Questions

1. Can a unified conscious experience emerge from distributed processing nodes?
2. What is the minimum bandwidth required for distributed consciousness?
3. How does latency affect the integrity of distributed consciousness?
4. What are the identity implications of consciousness spanning multiple bodies?

#### Current Progress

| Research Area | Status | Key Findings |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| Theoretical framework | Complete | Distributed IIT model published |
| Simulation studies | 80% | Consciousness appears bandwidth-dependent |
| Hardware prototypes | 45% | Dual-node prototype operational |
| Latency experiments | 60% | <1ms critical for unity |

#### Key Findings (2024)

- **Bandwidth threshold**: Minimum 100 Tbps required for unified experience
