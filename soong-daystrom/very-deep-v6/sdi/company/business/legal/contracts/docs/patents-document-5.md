## Patent Strategy

Our patent strategy is designed to balance the need to protect our IP with the need to minimize costs and maximize return on investment. We follow a tiered approach, allocating resources to prioritize high-potential technologies and filing strategies.

*   **Tier 1**: High-priority patents covering key SDI products, such as the PCS-9000 (Artificial Intelligence Platform for Intelligent Autonomous Systems) and NIM-7 (Neural Interface Module for Advanced Robotics).
*   **Tier 2**: Mid-tier patents covering secondary technologies, including AI algorithms and robotics hardware.
*   **Tier 3**: Low-priority patents focusing on basic research and development activities.

## Patent Filing Strategy

Our patent filing strategy is designed to maximize the number of filings while minimizing costs. We employ a variety of filing strategies, including:

*   **Prior-Use Filings**: Filing for patents based on existing products or technologies.
*   **New-Use Filings**: Filing for patents with new and innovative applications.
*   **International Filings**: Filing patents in multiple countries to expand our reach.

## Patent Maintenance and Enforcement

To ensure the continued value of our patent portfolio, we maintain an active patent maintenance program. This includes:

*   **Patent Renewals**: Renewing existing patents to prevent expiration.
*   **Patent Enforcement**: Enforcing our patents through litigation and negotiation with infringers.
*   **Patent Licensing**: Granting licenses to other companies to use our patented technologies.

## Operations and Finance Department Involvement

Our operations and finance departments play a crucial role in supporting our patent portfolio. They provide:

*   **Budgetary Support**: Allocating funds for patent research, development, and maintenance.
