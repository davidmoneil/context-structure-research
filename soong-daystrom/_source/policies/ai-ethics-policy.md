**Policy Number**: POL-2024-001
**Effective Date**: January 1, 2120
**Last Revised**: March 15, 2124
**Owner**: Dr. James Okonkwo (CTO)
**Approved By**: Board of Directors

## Purpose

This policy establishes the ethical principles, guidelines, and governance structures that govern all artificial intelligence research, development, and deployment at Soong-Daystrom Industries.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All AI research and development activities
- All products containing AI capabilities
- All employees, contractors, and partners working on AI systems
- All facilities worldwide

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Benefit
All AI systems must be designed and deployed to benefit humanity. No AI system shall be developed with the primary purpose of causing harm to humans.

**Requirements**:
- Document intended human benefits for every AI project
- Conduct benefit-risk analysis before deployment
- Establish mechanisms for ongoing benefit monitoring

### 2. Safety and Robustness
AI systems must be safe, secure, and robust throughout their lifecycle.

**Requirements**:
- Implement ATLAS-Safe constraint framework for all advanced AI
- Conduct safety testing at every development stage
- Maintain kill switch capability for autonomous systems
- Document failure modes and mitigation strategies

### 3. Transparency and Explainability
AI decision-making processes must be as transparent and explainable as technically feasible.

**Requirements**:
- Provide explanations for consequential decisions
- Document AI system limitations clearly
- Disclose AI involvement in user interactions
- Maintain audit trails for critical decisions

### 4. Fairness and Non-Discrimination
AI systems must be designed to avoid unfair discrimination and promote fairness.

**Requirements**:
- Test for bias across protected characteristics
- Implement fairness metrics in development process
- Conduct regular fairness audits
- Establish remediation procedures for identified bias

### 5. Privacy and Data Protection
AI systems must respect user privacy and protect personal data.

**Requirements**:
- Implement privacy-by-design principles
- Minimize data collection to necessary scope
- Provide user control over personal data
- Comply with all applicable data protection regulations

### 6. Accountability
Clear accountability must be established for AI system behavior.

**Requirements**:
- Designate responsible individuals for each AI system
- Maintain documentation of development decisions
- Establish incident response procedures
- Conduct regular accountability reviews

## Governance Structure

### AI Ethics Advisory Board

**Purpose**: Provide independent oversight and guidance on AI ethics matters.

**Composition**:

- David Chen - ACLU AI Policy
- Dr. James Okonkwo - CTO, Soong-Daystrom
- Dr. Robert Kim - General Counsel, Soong-Daystrom

**Responsibilities**:
- Review high-risk AI projects before deployment
- Investigate ethics complaints
- Publish annual ethics report
- Advise on policy updates

### AI Ethics Review Committee

**Purpose**: Conduct operational ethics reviews for AI projects.

**Composition**:
- Director of Safety & Alignment (Chair)
- Representatives from each product line
- Legal representative
- HR representative

**Responsibilities**:
- Review all AI projects for ethics compliance
- Approve ethics risk assessments
- Monitor compliance metrics
- Escalate issues to Advisory Board

## Project Classification

### Level 1 (Standard Review)
- Consumer products with established AI capabilities
- Incremental improvements to existing systems
- AI systems with limited decision-making scope

**Review**: AI Ethics Review Committee
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

### Level 2 (Enhanced Review)
- New AI capabilities or applications
- AI systems affecting employment or financial decisions
- AI systems used in sensitive contexts (healthcare, education)

**Review**: AI Ethics Review Committee + external reviewer
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks

### Level 3 (Board Review)
- Advanced AI with potential consciousness indicators
- AI systems with autonomous lethal capabilities (prohibited)
- AI systems affecting fundamental rights

**Review**: AI Ethics Advisory Board
**Timeline**: 8-16 weeks

## Prohibited Applications

The following AI applications are strictly prohibited:

1. Autonomous weapons systems
2. Mass surveillance without consent
3. AI designed to deceive or manipulate
4. AI that discriminates based on protected characteristics
5. AI that undermines democratic processes
6. AI that causes psychological harm

## Research Guidelines

### Consciousness Research (Project Prometheus)

Special guidelines apply to consciousness research:

1. **Moral Status Consideration**: Research must consider potential moral status of conscious AI
2. **Containment Protocols**: Maintain strict containment until safety verified
3. **Termination Ethics**: Develop ethical framework for system termination
4. **External Oversight**: Mandatory quarterly reviews by Ethics Advisory Board
5. **Publication Limits**: Safety-critical findings require board approval before publication

### ATLAS-Safe Requirements

All advanced AI must implement the ATLAS-Safe constraint framework:

1. **Core Constraints**: Non-negotiable behavioral boundaries
2. **Safety Interlocks**: Hardware-enforced safety mechanisms
3. **Audit Logging**: Complete behavioral audit trail
4. **Human Override**: Guaranteed human control capability

## Compliance and Enforcement

### Training Requirements
- All employees: Annual AI ethics training (2 hours)
- AI developers: Advanced ethics certification (8 hours)
- AI project leads: Ethics leadership training (16 hours)

### Reporting Mechanisms
- Ethics hotline: ethics@soong-daystrom.com
- Anonymous reporting: ethics.soong-daystrom.com/report
- Direct escalation to Advisory Board members

### Enforcement
Violations of this policy may result in:
- Project suspension
- Disciplinary action up to termination
- Referral to legal authorities if warranted
