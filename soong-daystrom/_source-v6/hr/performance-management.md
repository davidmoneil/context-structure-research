## Philosophy and Purpose

Soong-Daystrom Industries' performance management system is designed to drive exceptional results while developing our people. We believe that effective performance management is a continuous process of setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback, supporting development, and recognizing contributions.

### Core Beliefs

**Performance is a Partnership**: Managers and employees share responsibility for performance outcomes. Managers provide direction, resources, and feedback; employees bring commitment, effort, and growth orientation.

**Feedback is a Gift**: Timely, honest feedback accelerates development and prevents problems from festering. We create psychological safety for candid conversations.

**Growth Mindset**: We believe capabilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. Past performance does not determine future potential.

**Differentiation Matters**: Recognizing and rewarding high performers is essential to retention and motivation. We make clear distinctions in recognition and rewards.

### System Objectives

| Objective | Measure | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Clear expectations | % employees with documented goals | 100% |
| Regular feedback | 1:1s per month (average) | 2+ |
| Development focus | IDPs completed | 95% |
| Differentiation | Forced distribution achievement | Within 5% |
| Manager capability | Manager effectiveness score | 85%+ |
| Employee satisfaction | PM system satisfaction | 75%+ |

## Annual Performance Cycle

### Timeline Overview

| Phase | Timing | Key Activities |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Goal Setting | January | Annual goals established, cascaded from company strategy |
| Q1 Check-In | April | Progress review, goal adjustment if needed |
| Mid-Year Review | July | Formal mid-year discussion, development check |
| Q3 Check-In | October | Final push, year-end preview |
| Year-End Review | November | Performance assessment, calibration, ratings |
| Compensation Planning | December | Merit, bonus, equity decisions |
| Communication | January | Compensation communication, new goal cycle begins |

---

## Goal Setting

### Goal Philosophy

Goals should be:
- **Aligned**: Connected to company strategy and team objectives
- **Meaningful**: Represent significant contributions and priorities
- **Measurable**: Include success criteria that enable objective assessment
- **Achievable**: Challenging but realistic given resources and constraints
- **Time-bound**: Have clear deadlines and milestones

### Goal Categories

Employees set goals across three categories:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Business Results | 50-60% | What you deliver: outputs, outcomes, metrics |
| How Results | 20-30% | How you achieve results: behaviors, values |
| Development | 10-20% | Growth objectives: skills, capabilities, experiences |

### Number of Goals

| Level | Recommended Goals |
|-------|-------------------|
| Individual Contributor | 4-6 goals |
| Manager | 5-7 goals |
| Director+ | 6-8 goals |

### Goal Quality Criteria

**Strong Goal Example**:
*"Deliver Project Atlas Phase 2 by Q3 with all critical features (customer dashboard, predictive maintenance, safety compliance) complete, achieving >85% customer satisfaction in pilot and <$50M budget variance."*

**Weak Goal Example**:
*"Work on Project Atlas and help the team succeed."*

### Goal Cascading

Company strategy cascades through the organization:

```
Company Strategic Priorities
    ↓
Division/Function Goals
    ↓
Department Goals
    ↓
Team Goals
    ↓
Individual Goals
```

### Goal Documentation

All goals are documented in Workday:
1. Navigate to Performance > Goals
2. Create goals for current year
3. Select category and weighting
4. Add success criteria and milestones
5. Submit for manager alignment discussion
6. Manager reviews and approves (or discusses adjustments)

---

## Ongoing Feedback and Coaching

### 1:1 Meetings

Regular 1:1 meetings between managers and employees are the foundation of effective performance management.

**Frequency**: Minimum bi-weekly (weekly preferred for new employees)
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Owner**: Employee drives agenda; manager coaches

**Recommended 1:1 Structure**:
| Segment | Time | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| Check-in | 5 min | Personal connection, well-being |
| Employee updates | 15-20 min | Progress, blockers, wins |
| Manager input | 10-15 min | Feedback, information sharing |
| Development | 10 min | Growth, career, learning |
| Action items | 5 min | Commitments, next steps |

### Feedback Best Practices

**Effective Feedback Model: SBI+I**

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Specific context | "In yesterday's design review..." |
| **B**ehavior | Observable actions | "...you interrupted Dr. Hassan three times..." |
| **I**mpact | Effect on others/results | "...which made it difficult for him to complete his point and may have discouraged junior team members from speaking up." |
| +**I**ntent/Inquiry | Understanding and forward look | "I wanted to share this because I know you value collaboration. What was going on for you?" |

**Feedback Timing**:
- Positive feedback: Give immediately and publicly (when appropriate)
- Constructive feedback: Give promptly and privately
- Never: Save feedback for annual review

### Continuous Feedback Platform

SDI uses a continuous feedback platform integrated with Workday:

**Features**:
- Request feedback from anyone at any time
- Provide recognition and appreciation
- Track feedback received and given
- Connect feedback to goals
- Generate reports for review preparation

---

## Mid-Year Review

### Purpose

The mid-year review is a formal checkpoint to:
- Assess progress toward annual goals
- Adjust goals if business priorities have changed
- Discuss development progress
- Identify support needs
- Calibrate expectations for year-end

### Mid-Year Process

| Step | Timing | Activity |
|------|--------|----------|
| Employee self-assessment | July 1-7 | Employee documents progress in Workday |
| Manager preparation | July 8-14 | Manager reviews and prepares feedback |
| Mid-year discussion | July 15-31 | 60-90 minute conversation |
| Documentation | August 1-7 | Manager completes mid-year summary |

### Mid-Year Assessment Categories

| Rating | Definition | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| On Track | Progressing as expected toward all goals | Continue current approach |
| Needs Attention | Some goals at risk; action needed | Create remediation plan |
| Off Track | Significant gaps; intervention required | Intensive support or performance plan |

### Goal Adjustment Guidelines

Goals may be adjusted at mid-year when:
- Business priorities have materially changed
- Organizational restructuring affects scope
- Resource constraints make goals unachievable
- New strategic opportunities emerge

Goals should NOT be adjusted:
- Simply because the goal is challenging
- To avoid accountability for poor progress
- Without manager and skip-level approval
