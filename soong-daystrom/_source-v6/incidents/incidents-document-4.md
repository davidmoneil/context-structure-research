## Introduction

Security is a critical component of our overall strategy at Soong-Daystrom Industries. Our commitment to protecting sensitive information, intellectual property, and proprietary technologies has been unwavering throughout our history. As we continue to innovate and expand our product offerings, we must remain vigilant in identifying and addressing potential security threats.

### Key Objectives

2.  Enhance collaboration between departments to ensure timely identification and reporting of security incidents.
3.  Implement regular security awareness training for all employees, including contractors and partners.
4.  Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

## Security Incident Management Process

Our security incident response plan is designed to ensure swift action in the event of a breach or security incident. The process involves the following steps:

1.  **Identification**: The first step in responding to a security incident is identification. This involves detecting an unusual activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or data breaches.
2.  **Assessment**: Once identified, the incident must be assessed to determine its scope and impact. This includes evaluating the potential consequences of the incident on our business, customers, and stakeholders.

## Collaborative Response

Effective collaboration between departments is critical in responding to security incidents. Our response involves the following:

1.  **Incident Reporting**: All security incidents must be reported to the Security Operations Center (SOC) within a reasonable timeframe.
2.  **Departmental Coordination**: The SOC coordinates with relevant departments, such as R&D, Finance, Legal, and Operations, to address incident impacts.

## Continuous Improvement

Our commitment to continuous improvement is reflected in our ongoing efforts to enhance security measures. These include:
