## Chapter 2: Initial Setup and Activation

### 2.1 Unboxing Your PCS-500

Your PCS-500 arrives in Transport Mode, a low-power state that preserves the fusion cell during shipping. The unit will be in a seated position within the protective packaging.

**Step 1**: Remove the outer transport container and set aside all documentation and accessory packages.

**Step 2**: Locate the four transport locks (two on each leg, indicated by yellow tabs). Pull each tab firmly to release the locks.

**Step 3**: The PCS-500 can now be carefully moved to your desired activation location. We recommend a clear space of at least 2m x 2m for initial activation.

**Step 4**: Position the Docking Station within 3m of the activation location and connect to power. The station's indicator light will turn solid green when ready.

### 2.2 First Activation Procedure

**Important**: First activation should occur in a quiet environment with good lighting. The PCS-500 will perform initial environmental calibration during this process.

1. Ensure the Docking Station shows solid green status
2. Locate the activation panel behind the left ear (small oval cover)
3. Press the panel to reveal the activation button
4. Press and hold the blue activation button for 5 seconds
5. Release when you hear the initialization chime

The PCS-500 will progress through the following startup sequence:

| Phase | Duration | Indicator |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| System Check | 15 sec | Eyes pulse blue |
| Motor Calibration | 30 sec | Subtle limb movements |
| Sensor Initialization | 20 sec | Eyes shift to amber |
| Neural Core Boot | 45 sec | Eyes fade to white |
| Personality Load | 60 sec | Natural eye movement begins |
| Ready | - | Greeting initiated |

### 2.3 Primary User Registration

During first activation, your PCS-500 will initiate the Primary User Registration sequence. This establishes you as the primary owner and configures initial preferences.

The registration process includes:

- **Biometric Enrollment**: Facial recognition, voice pattern, and gait analysis
- **Name Selection**: Choose how your PCS-500 will address you
- **Companion Name**: Select a name for your PCS-500 or use the factory designation
- **Communication Style**: Formal, casual, or adaptive
- **Privacy Settings**: Configure data retention and sharing preferences
- **Household Integration**: Connect to your home automation systems

**Note**: Additional users can be registered later through the Settings menu. The PCS-500 supports up to 12 registered household members with individual preference profiles.

### 2.4 Home Network Integration

Your PCS-500 can integrate with standard home automation protocols:

- **SDI HomeLink** (native support)
- **Matter 3.0** (certified compatible)
- **Z-Wave Plus v3** (adapter required)
- **Thread 2.0** (native support)
- **Legacy WiFi 6E/7** (backward compatible)

To connect your home network:

1. Say "Begin network setup" or access Settings > Network > Home Integration
2. Your PCS-500 will scan for available networks and smart home hubs
3. Select your primary network and enter credentials when prompted
4. Grant access permissions for each detected smart home system
5. The PCS-500 will map your home over the following 24-48 hours

## Chapter 3: Daily Operation

### 3.1 Interaction Modes

Your PCS-500 offers multiple interaction modes optimized for different situations:

**Companion Mode** (Default)
The PCS-500 functions as a social companion, engaging in conversation, providing emotional support, and participating in household activities. Response latency is optimized for natural conversation flow.

**Assistant Mode**
Task-focused operation with enhanced scheduling, reminder, and organizational capabilities. The PCS-500 will proactively manage calendars, appointments, and household logistics.

**Activity Mode**
Optimized for physical activities including exercise, games, and outdoor adventures. Motor response is enhanced and safety monitoring is elevated.

**Quiet Mode**
Reduced vocalization and movement. The PCS-500 remains available but will not initiate interaction unless addressed or unless safety concerns arise.

**Sleep Mode**
Minimal presence during designated sleep hours. The PCS-500 will retire to the Docking Station and suppress all non-emergency notifications.

### 3.2 Voice Commands

Your PCS-500 processes significant personal information to function effectively. SDI is committed to responsible data handling:

**On-Device Processing**: Whenever possible, data is processed locally on your PCS-500's neural core. This includes daily conversations, routine activities, and preference learning.

**Cloud Processing**: Some advanced features require cloud processing. These include:
- Complex query resolution
- Skill pack updates
- Multi-location synchronization
- Professional service connections (healthcare, etc.)

**Data Retention**: Local data is retained until you choose to delete it. Cloud-processed data is anonymized within 30 days unless longer retention is required for specific services you've enabled.

### 7.2 Privacy Controls

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Conversation Recording | Store conversation history | On |
| Location Tracking | Track and store locations visited | On |
| Biometric Storage | Retain visitor biometric data | Off |
| Analytics Sharing | Share anonymized usage data | Off |
| Professional Sharing | Share data with healthcare providers | Off |
| Guest Recording | Record interactions in Guest Mode | Off |

Access privacy controls through Settings > Privacy or by commanding "Privacy settings."

### 7.3 Privacy Mode

Privacy Mode temporarily suspends all recording and logging:
- Say "Privacy mode on" to activate
- All recording stops immediately
- Minimal necessary processing continues for functionality
- Say "Privacy mode off" to resume normal operation
- Usage during Privacy Mode is not logged

### 7.4 Security Features

**Biometric Authentication**: Primary users are authenticated continuously through voice, facial recognition, and behavioral analysis.

**Guest Access**: Unregistered individuals receive limited interaction through Guest Mode. You control what information is shared.

**Encryption**: All stored data uses AES-512 encryption. All network communications use TLS 1.4.

**Physical Security**: The PCS-500 will not leave designated areas without an authenticated user or specific instruction.

**Tamper Detection**: Unauthorized access attempts trigger immediate lockdown and owner notification.
