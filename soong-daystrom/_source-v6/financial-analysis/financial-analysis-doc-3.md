| FY 2125 | 5,290 M credits | 38.8% | Mainstream | 74% |

**Application Breakdown (FY 2125 Projection):**
- Medical diagnostics & therapeutic applications: 38% (1,998 M credits)
- Cognitive enhancement and research: 31% (1,640 M credits)
- Industrial human-machine interface: 18% (951 M credits)
- Consumer and education applications: 13% (688 M credits)

Under the strategic oversight of Dr. James Okonkwo (Chief Technology Officer), the NIM-7 platform has achieved clinical validation for three primary therapeutic applications, with regulatory approvals expected to progress through FY 2124. Gross margins in medical applications exceed 71%, substantially higher than earlier-stage market segments.

#### AI & Infrastructure Platforms

The Integrated Analytics Platform (IAP) and associated artificial intelligence services represent strategic growth vectors, particularly through the Prometheus project (advanced AI safety research) and Atlas infrastructure initiatives.

**FY 2122-2125 Platform Revenue:**

| Year | Revenue | Segment Composition | Enterprise Customers |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| FY 2122 | 1,800 M credits | Cloud Services 45%, Software Licensing 38%, Research Services 17% | 2,340 |
| FY 2123 | 2,150 M credits | Cloud Services 46%, Software Licensing 39%, Research Services 15% | 2,890 |
| FY 2124 | 2,390 M credits | Cloud Services 48%, Software Licensing 38%, Research Services 14% | 3,420 |
| FY 2125 | 2,800 M credits | Cloud Services 51%, Software Licensing 36%, Research Services 13% | 3,980 |

The IAP platform demonstrates strong enterprise adoption momentum, with software-as-a-service contract values increasing 24% annually. The Hermes logistics project, leveraging both IAP infrastructure and advanced analytics capabilities, is projected to generate 340 million credits in dedicated project revenue by FY 2125, representing new addressable market capture.
