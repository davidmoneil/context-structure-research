- **EMEA:** 31% ($1.302B) - Emerging growth at 19.7%
- **Asia-Pacific:** 22% ($924M) - Rapid expansion at 31.2%
- **Other:** 5% ($210M) - Strategic markets at 15.8%

The Asia-Pacific region presents our highest-growth opportunity, driven by regulatory approvals in Japan (2123), South Korea, and Singapore. We project this region to represent 26% of revenue by FY2126.

### 1.3 Product Contribution Analysis

**PCS-9000 Robotics Series:**
- FY2124 Revenue: $1.12B (26.7% of total)
- Unit Sales: 312 systems (avg. $3.59M per unit)
- Gross Margin: 68%
- Projected FY2125 Revenue: $1.38B (+23.2%)

The PCS-9000 line demonstrates strong enterprise stickiness with 94% customer retention and 34% upsell conversion rates. Our installed base has reached 1,247 units globally, representing significant recurring service revenue (maintenance contracts now exceed $180M annually).

**NIM-7 Neural Interface:**
- FY2124 Revenue: $1.41B (33.6% of total)
- Unit Sales: 4,820 systems (avg. $292K per unit)
- Gross Margin: 62%
- Projected FY2125 Revenue: $1.76B (+24.8%)

The NIM-7 platform achieved regulatory approval in 14 additional jurisdictions during FY2124, expanding our addressable market to $28.4 billion. Medical device partnerships with leading healthcare systems provide predictable recurring revenue through licensing arrangements.

- Q3: 28% (largest enterprise procurements; summer implementations)
- Q4: 26% (year-end budget utilization; holiday seasonality impact offset by renewal cycles)

**FY2125 Projected Quarterly Operating Cash Flow:**
- Q1 FY2125: $278M
- Q2 FY2125: $305M
- Q3 FY2125: $334M
