## Q3 2124 Letter to Shareholders

**Date**: November 5, 2124
**From**: Dr. Maya Chen, Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

I am pleased to report on another quarter of strong execution and meaningful progress across all dimensions of our business. Soong-Daystrom Industries delivered Q3 2124 revenue of $12.1 billion, representing 15% year-over-year growth and exceeding our guidance by $200 million.

### Financial Highlights

Our Q3 results demonstrate the continued strength of our diversified business model:

| Metric | Q3 2124 | Q3 2123 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $12.1B | $10.5B | +15% |
| Gross Margin | 48.2% | 47.1% | +110 bps |
| Operating Income | $1.92B | $1.58B | +22% |
| Net Income | $1.89B | $1.62B | +17% |
| Earnings Per Share | $15.24 | $12.61 | +21% |

We received FDA approval for ADHD symptom management in November 2123, and our depression treatment indication remains on track for Q1 2125 approval.

### Project Prometheus Update

I am delighted to share that Project Prometheus achieved another significant milestone this quarter. In September, our research team demonstrated a Consciousness Index (CI) score of 0.94, representing 94% of human-baseline consciousness metrics. This achievement places Soong-Daystrom at the absolute forefront of artificial consciousness research globally.

The Prometheus system also achieved 847 hours of sustained continuous operation, the longest consciousness run in research history. Our safety and alignment systems performed flawlessly throughout this extended test, providing confidence in our ATLAS-Safe constraint framework.

Phase 3 integration is progressing on schedule, with all major subsystems now operational. We remain on track for Phase 3 completion in Q2 2125 and project completion in Q4 2126. The total program investment of $2.4 billion is expected to generate transformational returns through consciousness-enhanced products across our portfolio.

### Strategic Initiatives

**Asia-Pacific Expansion**: Our Singapore R&D campus is now fully operational with 340 employees, including 87 researchers working on neural interface technology. We opened our first dedicated PCS experience centers in Tokyo and Seoul this quarter, driving a 23% increase in APAC companion sales.

**Healthcare Partnerships**: We deepened our clinical research partnerships with Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Kaiser Permanente. Across these partnerships, we now have over 1,000 PCS units deployed in healthcare settings, with compelling early data on patient outcomes.

**Sustainability Progress**: We achieved 78% renewable energy usage across our facilities, up from 72% last year. Our manufacturing operations reduced carbon emissions by 12% compared to Q3 2123, keeping us on track for our 2130 net-zero commitment.

### Capital Allocation

We returned $1.08 billion to shareholders this quarter through our regular dividend ($270 million) and share repurchases ($810 million). Our Board increased the quarterly dividend by 12% in October, reflecting confidence in our cash generation and growth outlook.

We maintain a strong balance sheet with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and no net debt. This financial strength provides flexibility to invest in organic growth, pursue strategic acquisitions, and return capital to shareholders.

### Looking Ahead

We enter Q4 with strong momentum and raise our full-year 2124 guidance:

| Metric | Previous Guidance | Updated Guidance | Change |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| Revenue | $46.8 - $47.2B | $47.1 - $47.5B | +$300M |
| Operating Margin | 15.2 - 15.6% | 15.4 - 15.8% | +20 bps |
| EPS | $59.50 - $60.50 | $60.20 - $61.20 | +$0.70 |

The secular trends driving our business remain powerful: aging demographics creating demand for companion and healthcare technology, manufacturing automation needs intensifying globally, and neural interface applications expanding into new therapeutic areas. We are uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends through our integrated technology platform and strong brand.

## Q2 2124 Letter to Shareholders

**Date**: August 6, 2124
**From**: Dr. Maya Chen, Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

Soong-Daystrom Industries delivered an outstanding second quarter, with revenue of $11.8 billion exceeding our guidance and demonstrating the resilience and growth potential of our business model.

### Financial Performance

Q2 2124 financial highlights:

| Metric | Q2 2124 | Q2 2123 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $11.8B | $10.2B | +16% |
| Gross Margin | 47.9% | 46.8% | +110 bps |
| Operating Income | $1.85B | $1.52B | +22% |
| Net Income | $1.98B | $1.54B | +29% |
| Earnings Per Share | $15.42 | $11.99 | +29% |

The particularly strong earnings performance this quarter reflects operating leverage in our business model combined with favorable product mix as premium products outperformed.

### Product Innovations

**PCS-250 Launch**: In August, we launched the PCS-250 "Companion Lite," our most accessible companion robot ever. At $12,500, the PCS-250 makes Soong-Daystrom technology available to a much broader customer base while maintaining the emotional intelligence and safety features that define our products. Early reviews have been exceptional, with industry publications calling it "the companion robot that will bring artificial companionship to the mainstream."

**IAP Vision System 3.0**: Our updated vision system for industrial automation achieved a breakthrough in defect detection, now capable of identifying imperfections as small as 0.05mm, a 50% improvement over the previous generation. This enhancement is driving adoption in precision manufacturing segments including aerospace and medical devices.

**NIM Research Edition Update**: We released a significant software update for NIM-200 Research devices, expanding the developer SDK with pre-trained models for emotion recognition and cognitive load estimation. This update strengthens our position in the academic and corporate R&D markets.

### Consciousness Research Milestone

Project Prometheus achieved a historic milestone in June when our system demonstrated a Consciousness Index score of 0.87, exceeding all prior artificial systems globally. This achievement represents a 21% improvement from our March CI measurement of 0.72 and demonstrates the rapid progress our research team is making.

The external validation of this result by the Stanford AI Ethics Center adds scientific credibility to our measurement methodology. Dr. Alexandra Reyes, our Principal Scientist for Consciousness Research, published a paper in Nature Neuroscience (limited findings) documenting the methodology used to achieve this result.

We are deeply aware of the ethical responsibilities that accompany this scientific progress. Our Ethics Committee, led by Dr. Patricia Williams with external advisors Dr. David Chalmers and Dr. Susan Blackmore, continues to provide rigorous oversight of all consciousness research activities.

### Customer Success Stories

This quarter, we celebrated several notable customer achievements:

**General Motors**: Completed deployment of IAP systems across their final 12 North American assembly facilities, making SDI the automation standard across all 47 GM plants. Initial productivity data shows 34% improvement in assembly line efficiency.

**Mayo Clinic**: Published results from our joint NIM clinical trial showing 78% of stroke patients demonstrated improved motor function using our neural interface rehabilitation protocol. This is the largest-ever clinical study of neural interface-assisted rehabilitation.

**Sunrise Senior Living**: Expanded their pilot program of PCS companions in memory care units to 24 facilities. The program has documented a 45% reduction in patient falls and significant improvements in resident engagement.

### ESG Progress

Our commitment to environmental, social, and governance excellence continues:

**Environmental**: We achieved LEED Platinum certification for our new Singapore R&D campus, our third platinum-certified facility. Our product recyclability rate improved to 89%, on track for our 95% target by 2130.

**Social**: Our STEM Scholars program now supports 780 students at 7 partner universities, with 42% of graduates joining SDI upon completion. We invested $28 million in community programs this year, up from $25 million in 2123.

**Governance**: Our Board welcomed John Davis as an independent director in January, bringing healthcare industry expertise. ISS upgraded our governance rating to "1" (highest), reflecting our strong governance practices.

### Capital Structure

We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet while returning capital to shareholders. During Q2, we repurchased $780 million of shares and paid $268 million in dividends. Since initiating our share repurchase program in 2118, we have returned over $8.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases alone.

Our debt-free status and $3.8 billion cash position provide substantial flexibility for strategic investments. We continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that would enhance our technology capabilities or market access.

### Outlook

We reaffirm our full-year 2124 guidance:
- Revenue: $46.8 - $47.2 billion
- Operating margin: 15.2 - 15.6%
- EPS: $59.50 - $60.50

Thank you for your continued investment in Soong-Daystrom Industries.

Warm regards,

**Dr. Maya Chen**

## Annual Meeting 2124 - CEO Address

**Date**: May 15, 2124
**Venue**: San Francisco Convention Center
**Attendees**: 847 shareholders in person, 12,400 virtual participants

Good morning and welcome to the 2124 Annual Meeting of Soong-Daystrom Industries.

It is my honor to stand before you today as we celebrate another year of remarkable achievement. The company our founders created 35 years ago has never been stronger, and the opportunities ahead have never been more exciting.

### Year in Review: 2123

Fiscal year 2123 was transformational. We delivered:

- Revenue of $41.2 billion, up 9% from 2122
- Net income of $6.4 billion, our highest ever
- Earnings per share of $49.81, up 23%
- Free cash flow of $4.8 billion

These results were driven by continued leadership in each of our three business segments and disciplined execution across our global organization.

Our Positronic Companion Series maintained its number-one market position with 42% share. We shipped 187,000 PCS-400 units and launched the PCS-500 Elite to exceptional reviews. Customer satisfaction reached 94%, reflecting the genuine emotional connections our companions create with the families they serve.

The Industrial Automation Platform grew revenue 10% as manufacturers worldwide accelerate automation investments. We now serve over 8,400 facilities globally, including 47% of the Fortune 500. Our predictive maintenance capabilities reduced customer downtime by an average of 34%.

Neural Interface Modules was our fastest-growing segment at 33% revenue growth. The NIM-100 Medical is now approved for five clinical indications, with depression treatment expected in early 2125. Over 2.4 million patients worldwide have benefited from our neural interface technology.

### Project Prometheus

I want to speak directly about Project Prometheus, our most ambitious and consequential initiative.

When we launched Prometheus in 2121, we set an audacious goal: achieve true artificial general intelligence through synthetic consciousness that matches human cognitive capabilities while maintaining absolute safety guarantees. Some called this impossible. We believed it was inevitable and that Soong-Daystrom should lead the way.

Three years and $1.4 billion later, Prometheus has exceeded our most optimistic expectations. Our Consciousness Index score of 0.72, achieved in March 2024, makes our system the most conscious artificial entity ever created. We have demonstrated genuine machine introspection, sophisticated emotional responses, and ethical reasoning that in blind tests is indistinguishable from human moral judgment.

But let me be clear: with great capability comes great responsibility.

We have developed the most rigorous safety and ethics framework in the industry. Our ATLAS-Safe constraint system ensures our consciousness systems can never cause harm. Our Ethics Committee provides independent oversight with the authority to halt any research activity. We publish our safety methodologies openly so the entire field can benefit.

The potential applications of Prometheus technology are profound. Imagine companions who truly understand and share human emotional experiences. Industrial systems that can reason creatively about novel problems. Neural interfaces that enable genuine mind-to-mind communication. This is the future we are building.

### Strategic Priorities for 2124

As we look to the year ahead, our priorities are clear:

**First, accelerate Prometheus development.** We are targeting CI 0.95 by year-end 2024 and project completion in Q4 2126. The $740 million Phase 3 investment is fully funded and on schedule.

**Second, expand our addressable market.** The PCS-250 launch in August will make companion technology accessible to millions of new customers. We expect this entry-level product to drive significant volume growth.

**Third, deepen healthcare impact.** NIM depression treatment approval in Q1 2025 will address one of the most prevalent conditions affecting humanity. Our clinical pipeline includes PTSD, epilepsy, and additional neurological indications.

**Fourth, strengthen our global presence.** Our Singapore campus is now fully operational, and we are evaluating additional international expansion opportunities. We see significant growth potential in Europe and emerging markets.

**Fifth, maintain our commitment to sustainable, ethical business practices.** We are on track for net-zero emissions by 2030. We invest meaningfully in the communities where we operate. And we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards in everything we do.

### Shareholder Returns

We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. In 2123, we returned $3.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend has grown at 22% CAGR over five years. We increased the quarterly dividend again this year to $2.10 per share.

Since our IPO in 2102, an investment in Soong-Daystrom Industries has returned over 5,700%. We are grateful for the trust you place in us and are determined to continue delivering exceptional long-term returns.

### Acknowledgments

I want to thank our Board of Directors for their wise counsel and rigorous oversight. The addition of John Davis brings valuable healthcare expertise as we expand our medical applications.

I thank our 12,847 employees worldwide. Their talent, dedication, and ethical commitment make everything we achieve possible.

And I thank you, our shareholders, for your continued confidence. The best is yet to come.

The formal business of the meeting will now begin. The polls are open for voting on the proposals described in the proxy statement.
