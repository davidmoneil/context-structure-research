## Experimental Discoveries & Breakthroughs

### Neural Signal Processing
Dr. Wei Zhang's team published breakthrough research on novel wavelet-based neural signal decomposition. The new technique enables 34% more accurate separation of overlapping neural signals, addressing a critical limitation in high-density neural interfaces. Preliminary patent review indicates 5-6 distinct patentable innovations emerging from this work. Three peer-reviewed publications submitted to top-tier neuroscience journals.

### Materials Science
Advanced Materials Lab discovered unexpected superconducting properties in novel titanium-aluminum composite at 65 Kelvin (vs. previous requirement of 38 Kelvin for comparable materials). This 71% reduction in cooling requirements dramatically reduces device operational costs. Commercial applications could reduce implementation costs by 23-31% for high-density sensor arrays.

### AI Interpretability
The attention visualization breakthrough mentioned in Prometheus project has broader applications. Early tests show the methodology scales to 2,200+ parameter models (previously limited to ~500 parameters). This could revolutionize AI safety auditing and regulatory compliance verification across the industry.

### Autonomous Systems
Novel sensor fusion algorithms demonstrated 99.1% accuracy in detecting object motion intentions—enabling predictive collision avoidance 2.4 seconds earlier than previous systems. This breakthrough emerged from combining acoustic, electromagnetic, and temporal sensor data in previously unexplored ways.
