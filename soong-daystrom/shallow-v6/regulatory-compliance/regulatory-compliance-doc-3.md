## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT

### 4.1 Enterprise Risk Catalog

Soong-Daystrom maintains a comprehensive risk register covering 340 identified risk vectors across compliance, operational, financial, and reputational domains. This section addresses the top regulatory and compliance risks.

### 4.2 High-Risk Items (Active Monitoring)

#### Risk 1: NIM-7 Market Access Delays (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)

**Risk Description:** Delayed approval in Andorian and other restricted markets for NIM-7 neural interface due to additional safety data requirements.

**Key Dependencies:**
- Clinical trial completion (on schedule for 2124-Q4)
- Neuromonitoring data compilation (in progress; 78% complete)
- Regulatory submission refinement (Dr. James Okonkwo, CTO, directly overseeing)

**Financial Impact:** $12.3M contingent liability (if complete market denial; probabilistic estimate: $4.1M expected loss at 33% failure probability)

**Timeline Risk:** Each quarter of delay = $3.1M in deferred revenue

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Parallel submissions to alternative markets (3 backup regulatory pathways identified)
- Pre-submission consultation meetings scheduled for 2124-Q3 (4 jurisdictions)
- Enhanced neuromonitoring protocol expansion (accelerated to 2124-Q4)

**Owner:** Dr. James Okonkwo (CTO) with support from Marcus Williams (COO)  
**Review Frequency:** Monthly (Executive Steering Committee)

#### Risk 2: AI Governance Regulatory Acceleration (Probability: High, Impact: High)

**Risk Description:** Rapid evolution of AI governance regulations (particularly Earth Federation AIVA Framework updates) may require significant IAP platform modifications.

**Context:**
- AIVA released draft 2.0 framework specifications 2124-07-15
- Estimated implementation timeline: 18 months for full compliance
- SDI IAP Platform currently operates under 1.5 framework compliance

**Financial Impact:** Estimated $18.7M in development/remediation costs; $34M in potential revenue loss if compliance not achieved timely

**Technical Risk:** CTO Dr. James Okonkwo estimates 12 months required for AI model validation and testing; 6-month regulatory review after submission

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Dedicated task force (24 FTE allocation) began 2124-08-01
- Chief Scientist Dr. Wei Zhang serving as principal scientific validator
- Engagement with AIVA technical advisory committee (observer status)
- Phased implementation approach (core vs. optional modules)

**Budget Allocated:** $22.4M through 2125-Q2  
**Owner:** Dr. James Okonkwo (CTO), Dr. Wei Zhang (Chief Scientist)  
**Steering:** Board Technology Committee (monthly reviews)

#### Risk 3: Data Privacy Regulatory Fragmentation (Probability: High, Impact: Medium)

**Risk Description:** Increasing divergence between DPIA, AIVA, and regional data protection standards creating operational complexity and compliance burden.

**Current Status:**
- 7 primary jurisdictional frameworks monitored actively
- 4 framework updates issued in 2124 (2 materially affecting SDI operations)
- Estimated compliance cost increases: 12-18% annually

**Financial Impact:** Estimated $6.8M annual incremental compliance costs; potential $28M in API Platform revenue adjustments

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Consolidated data governance platform (Atlas Project infrastructure component) deployment 2124-Q4
- Compliance automation roadmap (targeting 34% manual effort reduction by 2125)
- Pre-regulatory engagement strategy with key jurisdictions (quarterly meetings)
- Flexible data residency architecture in all products

**Owner:** Marcus Williams (COO), Legal Division VP  
**Budget:** $8.2M through 2125  

#### Risk 4: Supply Chain Regulatory Gaps (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)

**Risk Description:** Third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers operating under outdated compliance certifications, creating enterprise liability exposure.

**Current State:**
- 47 primary suppliers identified for critical components
- 89% currently hold current certifications (audited 2124-Q2)
- 11% have certifications expiring in 2124-2125 period

**Financial Impact:** $2.1M potential penalties/remediation; estimated supply chain disruption risk: $14.3M

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Proactive supplier certification program (engaged 8 at-risk suppliers; 6 already achieved compliance)
- Contractual audit rights expansion in all new vendor agreements
- Redundant sourcing for 8 critical component categories
- Supply chain compliance monitoring system (deployment 2124-Q4)

**Owner:** Marcus Williams (COO), Supply Chain Division  
**Review:** Quarterly audit cycle

### 4.3 Medium-Risk Items (Quarterly Review)
