## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Vendor Management Policy establishes the framework, standards, and procedures for identifying, qualifying, contracting, managing, and evaluating third-party vendors providing goods and services to Soong-Daystrom Industries. Effective vendor management ensures that SDI receives quality products and services, manages supply chain risks, maintains compliance with legal and ethical requirements, and achieves optimal value.

Given SDI's unique position in positronic technology and consciousness research, this policy addresses specialized considerations for vendors in the synthetic being supply chain, consciousness-related technology providers, and suppliers of components critical to positronic brain manufacturing.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

- All procurement of goods and services by SDI globally
- All employees involved in vendor selection, contracting, or management
- All categories of vendors including suppliers, service providers, contractors, and consultants
- All contract values, with enhanced requirements for higher-value or higher-risk engagements
- Subsidiary and affiliated entities operating under SDI procurement governance

### 1.3 Key Definitions

**Vendor:** Any external party providing goods or services to SDI, including suppliers, service providers, contractors, consultants, and partners.

**Strategic Vendor:** Vendor providing critical goods or services essential to SDI operations or strategy, typically with annual spend exceeding 10M credits.

**Critical Component Vendor:** Vendor providing components or materials directly incorporated into positronic systems or other consciousness-capable technology.

**Approved Vendor List (AVL):** Maintained list of vendors qualified to provide specific categories of goods or services.

**Vendor Risk Assessment:** Evaluation of risks associated with a vendor relationship, including financial, operational, compliance, and reputational risks.
