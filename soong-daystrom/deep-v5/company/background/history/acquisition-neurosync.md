# NeuroSync Labs Acquisition

## Transaction Overview

**Announcement Date**: December 8, 2019
**Closing Date**: March 15, 2020
**Purchase Price**: $8.2 billion (all cash)
**Premium**: 34% over unaffected share price

## Strategic Rationale

### Background

NeuroSync Labs, founded in 2012, was the leading independent neural interface technology company. Their Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology represented the most advanced non-invasive neural interface commercially available.

### Acquisition Thesis

1. **Technology Gap**: Soong-Daystrom lacked expertise in neural interfaces
2. **Market Expansion**: Neural interfaces projected to be $47B market by 2030
3. **Product Integration**: BCI technology would enhance PCS and create new product lines
4. **Talent Acquisition**: NeuroSync team included world-leading neuroscientists
5. **Defensive Move**: Prevented competitors from acquiring critical technology

### CEO Statement (Dr. Maya Chen)
> "NeuroSync represents the missing piece in our vision for human-AI interaction. Their technology will enable a new generation of products that blur the line between human thought and AI assistance."
