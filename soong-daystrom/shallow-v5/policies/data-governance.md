## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Data Governance Policy establishes the framework, standards, and procedures for managing data as a strategic enterprise asset at Soong-Daystrom Industries. Effective data governance ensures that SDI data is accurate, secure, available, and used responsibly to support business operations, scientific research, regulatory compliance, and ethical obligations.

Given SDI's unique position in consciousness research and positronic technology, this policy addresses not only traditional data categories but also the complex considerations surrounding cognitive data, consciousness records, and synthetic being personal information.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

- All data created, collected, processed, stored, or transmitted by SDI
- All SDI employees, contractors, and third parties with data access
- All SDI systems, applications, and infrastructure handling data
- All SDI facilities worldwide
- Data about biological persons, synthetic beings, and organizational entities
- Research data, operational data, and administrative data

### 1.3 Key Definitions

**Data:** Any representation of information, including structured databases, unstructured documents, media files, and cognitive records.

**Personal Data:** Information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person or synthetic being.

**Cognitive Data:** Information derived from or representing the cognitive processes, memories, or experiences of a conscious being.

**Data Asset:** A data collection managed as a single unit with identified ownership and defined value.

**Data Steward:** Individual responsible for the quality, integrity, and appropriate use of specific data assets.

**Data Custodian:** Individual or team responsible for the technical management and security of data systems.
