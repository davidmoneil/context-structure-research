## Compensation Philosophy

Soong-Daystrom Industries' compensation philosophy is designed to attract, retain, and motivate the exceptional talent required to lead the future of artificial intelligence and robotics. We believe that fair, competitive, and transparent compensation is essential to our success.

### Guiding Principles

**1. Market Competitive**
We target total compensation at the 75th percentile of our competitive market for comparable roles. For critical skills and roles essential to our strategic priorities (positronic engineering, consciousness research, AI safety), we may target up to the 90th percentile.

**2. Internally Equitable**
We maintain fair pay relationships across similar roles within the organization. Our job architecture and compensation bands ensure that employees in comparable roles with similar experience and performance are compensated equitably.

**3. Performance Differentiated**
We differentiate compensation based on individual and company performance. High performers earn significantly more than average performers through merit increases, bonuses, and equity awards.

**4. Total Rewards Focused**
We consider total compensation holistically, including base salary, variable pay, equity, benefits, and career development opportunities. We communicate the full value of employment at SDI.

**5. Transparent and Understandable**
We strive for transparency in our compensation programs. Employees should understand how their pay is determined and what they can do to increase their earnings.

### Strategic Objectives

| Objective | Measure | Target |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Market competitiveness | Compa-ratio (position to market) | 1.00-1.10 |
| Internal equity | Pay equity ratio | 0.98-1.02 |
| Performance differentiation | Merit spread (high vs. average) | 1.5x |
| Offer acceptance rate | Offers accepted / extended | >90% |
| Regretted turnover (comp-related) | Exits citing pay | <3% |
