# The Founding of Soong-Daystrom Industries

## Origins (2085-2089)

### The Founders

**Dr. Arik Soong III** (2041-2128)
- Third-generation AI researcher in the Soong family
- Pioneer of positronic neural network architecture
- Stanford Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience (2067)
- Former Director of Stanford AI Lab (2078-2089)

**Dr. Richard Daystrom Jr.** (2039-2121)
- Son of legendary computer architect Dr. Richard Daystrom
- Revolutionary work in multi-threaded consciousness modeling
- MIT Ph.D. in Computer Architecture (2064)
- Former IBM Fellow (2070-2089)

### The Meeting

The two visionaries first met at the 2085 International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence in Tokyo. Their complementary expertise—Soong's work on neural substrate and Daystrom's architectural innovations—sparked an immediate intellectual partnership.

Over the following years, they collaborated on several influential papers:
- "Toward Positronic Consciousness" (2086)
- "Multi-threaded Self-Modeling in Artificial Systems" (2087)
- "A Unified Architecture for Synthetic Minds" (2088)

### The Decision

By late 2088, both researchers had grown frustrated with the constraints of academic funding and corporate bureaucracy. During a pivotal dinner in Palo Alto on November 14, 2088, they decided to found their own company.

> "We realized that to truly advance artificial consciousness, we needed to control not just the research, but the entire path from fundamental science to product. Academia moves too slowly; corporations move too cautiously. We needed a third way." — Dr. Arik Soong III, company history interview (2110)

## Founding (2089)

### Incorporation

**Soong-Daystrom Industries, Inc.** was incorporated in Delaware on March 15, 2089.

**Initial Structure**:
- Dr. Arik Soong III: Chairman & CEO
- Dr. Richard Daystrom Jr.: President & Chief Scientist
- Initial employees: 12 (all former Stanford/MIT researchers)

### Funding

**Seed Round** (April 2089): $47 million
- Sequoia Capital (lead)
- Andreessen Horowitz
- Stanford EndowmentIntel Capital

**Series A** (December 2089): $180 million
- SoftBank Vision Fund (lead)
- Previous investors

### First Headquarters

The company's first home was a converted warehouse at 1847 Industrial Way, San Mateo, California. The 24,000 square foot facility housed both offices and the first positronic research lab.

## Early Years (2089-2095)

### Project Genesis

The company's first major initiative, **Project Genesis**, aimed to create a functional positronic neural network capable of human-level pattern recognition.

**Key Milestones**:
- June 2090: First positronic node fabrication
- November 2091: 1,000-node network operational
- March 2093: Pattern recognition exceeds human baseline
- December 2094: First commercial prototype (Mark I)

### First Product: Mark I Assistant

The **Mark I** was unveiled at CES 2095. While primitive by today's standards, it represented a breakthrough in natural language interaction and task completion.

**Specifications**:
- 100,000 positronic nodes
- 8-hour battery life
- 847 pre-programmed tasks
- Price: $47,000

**Reception**: Critics praised the natural interaction but noted limited autonomy. Initial sales: 12,400 units in first year.

## Founding Principles

The founders established five core principles that continue to guide the company:

1. **Science First**: Fundamental research drives innovation
2. **Safety Always**: AI safety is non-negotiable
3. **Human Benefit**: Technology must serve humanity
4. **Long-term Thinking**: Sacrifice short-term gains for lasting impact
5. **Intellectual Honesty**: Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties

## Legacy

Dr. Richard Daystrom Jr. served as Chief Scientist until his retirement in 2115, and passed away in 2121. His contributions earned him the Turing Award (2108) and the National Medal of Science (2112).

Dr. Arik Soong III remained as Chairman until 2115, when he transitioned to Chairman Emeritus. He passed the CEO role to Dr. Maya Chen and continues to serve as an advisor. He received the Turing Award (2110) and was named to TIME's "100 Most Influential People" three times.

The company they built has grown from 12 employees in a San Mateo warehouse to over 12,000 employees across 14 countries, with products used by millions worldwide.
