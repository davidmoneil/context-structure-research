## 1. Introduction to NIM Technology

### 1.1 Platform Overview

The Neural Interface Module (NIM) platform represents Soong-Daystrom Industries' medical-grade neural interface technology. Developed in partnership with leading neuroscience research institutions, the NIM platform enables bidirectional communication between the nervous system and external devices.

NIM technology is built on three foundational innovations:

**Adaptive Microelectrode Arrays**: Flexible electrode substrates that conform to neural tissue and actively optimize signal acquisition over time.

**Neural Signal Processing Engine (NSPE)**: Proprietary algorithms for real-time decoding and encoding of neural signals with sub-millisecond latency.

**Biointegration Interface**: Surface treatments and materials that promote stable long-term integration while preventing adverse tissue responses.
