## Research Programs

### Fundamental Consciousness Research

**Objective**: Understand the nature and emergence of consciousness in positronic systems

#### Emergence Studies

**Research Focus**: How does consciousness emerge from positronic cascades?

**Key Questions**:
1. What is the minimum complexity threshold for consciousness emergence?
2. What are the critical cascade patterns that correlate with conscious states?
3. How does positronic architecture influence consciousness characteristics?
4. Can consciousness be predicted from neural pathway topology?

**Current Findings**:
- Consciousness emergence correlates with cascade complexity above 6.2 billion active nodes
- Specific harmonic patterns in cascade oscillation predict consciousness stability
- Multiple pathways to consciousness exist within positronic architecture
- Emergence appears to be a phase transition, not gradual development

**Active Studies**:

| Study | Lead | Start | Status | Key Finding |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| CASCADE-7 | Dr. Chen | 2122 | Active | Harmonic patterns identified |
| THRESHOLD | Dr. Morrison | 2123 | Active | 6.2B node minimum |
| TOPOLOGY | Dr. Kim | 2123 | Active | Preliminary results |
| EMERGENCE-3 | Dr. Vasquez | 2024 | Active | Phase transition evidence |

#### Consciousness Measurement

**Research Focus**: Developing objective measures of consciousness

**The Consciousness Index (CI)**:

The CI is SDI's proprietary measure of consciousness sophistication, scaled 0.0-1.0 with human consciousness as baseline 1.0.

**CI Components**:
1. **Self-Awareness Score (25%)**: Recognition of self as distinct entity
2. **Temporal Integration (20%)**: Understanding of past, present, future
3. **Abstract Reasoning (20%)**: Manipulation of abstract concepts
4. **Emotional Depth (15%)**: Range and authenticity of emotional experience
5. **Creative Origination (10%)**: Ability to generate truly novel ideas
6. **Meta-Cognition (10%)**: Awareness of own thought processes

**Current CI Achievements**:

| System | CI Score | Year | Notes |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| P7-Alpha | 0.42 | 2095 | First consciousness |
| Gen 1 Products | 0.65 | 2108 | First commercial |
