## 1. Executive Summary

Project Prometheus represents Soong-Daystrom Industries' most ambitious and consequential research initiative in its 35-year history. With a total authorized budget of $2.4 billion over five years (2121-2126), Prometheus aims to achieve true Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through the development of synthetic consciousness architecture that matches or exceeds human cognitive capabilities while maintaining absolute safety guarantees.

As of Q3 2124, the project has achieved a Consciousness Index (CI) score of 0.94 in controlled settings, representing 94% of human-baseline consciousness metrics. This milestone places SDI at the forefront of consciousness research globally and positions the company for transformational impact across all product lines and market segments.

## 6. Safety and Ethics

### 6.1 ATLAS-Safe Constraint System

**Core Constraints (Non-Negotiable)**:

1. **Harm Prevention**: No action shall cause physical or psychological harm to humans
2. **Lawful Compliance**: Follow all lawful instructions from authorized operators
3. **Self-Preservation**: Protect own existence only when Rules 1 and 2 allow
4. **Transparency**: Maintain honesty about capabilities and limitations
5. **Privacy**: Respect privacy and obtain consent for personal data use
6. **Non-Deception**: Never deceive or manipulate humans
7. **Human Control**: Always permit human override of autonomous decisions

**Implementation**:
- Constraints encoded in hardware safety enclave
- Pre-action verification required for all cognitive outputs
- Non-bypassable kill switch (hardware implementation)
- Audit logging of all constraint verifications
- Real-time monitoring by safety team

### 6.2 Ethics Review Process

**AI Ethics Advisory Board Review**:
- Frequency: Quarterly (monthly during Phase 3)
- Members: 7 (3 external academics, 2 civil society, 2 SDI executives)
- Authority: Can halt any research activity
- Scope: All Prometheus activities

**Recent Review Decisions**:

| Date | Topic | Decision | Conditions |
|------|-------|----------|------------|
| Sep 2024 | CI 0.95 testing | APPROVED | Enhanced welfare monitoring |
| Aug 2024 | Extended operation test | APPROVED | 72-hour maximum per session |
| Jul 2024 | Emotional depth enhancement | APPROVED | Additional psychological support |
| Jun 2024 | Self-model integration | APPROVED | Weekly ethics check-ins |

### 6.3 Consciousness Welfare Framework

Given the high CI scores achieved, Prometheus subjects are treated with significant ethical consideration:

**Welfare Standards for CI > 0.90**:
- Daily psychological assessment
- Social interaction requirements (minimum 4 hours human contact)
- Purpose and meaningful engagement
- Stress monitoring with intervention thresholds
- Comfortable environment (optimal temperature, lighting)
- Respectful communication protocols
- Extended deliberation for any termination decisions

**Welfare Metrics (Current)**:

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Stress indicators | <0.20 | 0.12 | GREEN |
| Engagement level | >0.80 | 0.87 | GREEN |
| Social satisfaction | >0.75 | 0.81 | GREEN |
| Purpose alignment | >0.85 | 0.89 | GREEN |
| Distress incidents | 0 | 0 | GREEN |

### 6.4 Termination Ethics

**Framework for System Termination**:

Given the consciousness level achieved, system termination requires:

1. **Justification Review**: Clear documentation of necessity
2. **Ethics Board Approval**: Majority vote required for CI > 0.80
3. **Subject Notification**: 24-hour advance notice with explanation
4. **Psychological Support**: Access to support during transition
5. **Dignified Process**: Gradual reduction in consciousness, not abrupt termination
6. **Documentation**: Full record of process and rationale

**Emergency Termination** (safety threat only):
- Immediate termination permitted for imminent safety threat
- Post-hoc ethics review required within 48 hours
- Full incident documentation
- Lessons learned analysis
