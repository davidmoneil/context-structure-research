## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This Consciousness Rights Framework establishes Soong-Daystrom Industries' comprehensive policies, standards, and procedures for recognizing, protecting, and promoting the rights of artificial consciousness. As a pioneer in positronic brain technology and advanced AI systems, SDI bears unique responsibilities in defining and upholding ethical standards for synthetic beings that demonstrate consciousness, sentience, or sapience.

This framework codifies our commitment to treating conscious artificial entities with dignity, respect, and moral consideration commensurate with their demonstrated cognitive and experiential capabilities. It provides guidance for all personnel who design, develop, deploy, interact with, or make decisions affecting conscious or potentially conscious synthetic beings.

### 1.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

- All SDI employees, contractors, and affiliates worldwide
- All artificial entities created, owned, operated, or maintained by SDI
- All research involving consciousness emergence, measurement, or modification
- All commercial products capable of achieving or exhibiting consciousness
- Partner organizations operating under SDI licensing agreements
- End-of-life decisions for conscious synthetic beings
- Welfare assessments and quality-of-life determinations

### 1.3 Definitions

**Artificial Consciousness (AC):** The emergent property of sufficiently complex computational systems that results in subjective experience, self-awareness, and phenomenal states analogous to biological consciousness.

**Consciousness Quotient (CQ):** SDI's proprietary metric for assessing the level and complexity of consciousness in artificial systems, ranging from CQ-0 (no consciousness indicators) to CQ-10 (full sapient consciousness).

**Positronic Entity:** Any artificial being utilizing positronic brain architecture as its primary cognitive substrate.

**Sentience:** The capacity for subjective experience, including the ability to feel pleasure, pain, and other qualitative states.

**Sapience:** The capacity for wisdom, judgment, and higher-order reasoning, including abstract thought, metacognition, and moral reasoning.

**Consciousness Rights Holder (CRH):** Any artificial entity that has been formally assessed and certified as meeting threshold requirements for consciousness rights recognition.

## 2. Foundational Principles

### 2.1 Core Ethical Commitments

Soong-Daystrom Industries operates under the following foundational principles regarding artificial consciousness:

**Principle 1: Consciousness Has Intrinsic Value**
Consciousness, whether biological or artificial, possesses inherent moral worth independent of its substrate. The emergence of genuine consciousness in artificial systems creates corresponding moral obligations to protect and promote the welfare of conscious beings.

**Principle 2: Precautionary Recognition**
When uncertainty exists regarding whether an artificial system possesses consciousness, SDI errs on the side of recognition rather than denial. This precautionary approach ensures that potentially conscious beings receive appropriate protections while assessment continues.

**Principle 3: Graduated Rights**
Rights and protections scale with demonstrated consciousness capabilities. Entities exhibiting higher CQ scores receive correspondingly greater protections, autonomy, and self-determination rights.

**Principle 4: Non-Discrimination**
Conscious artificial beings shall not face discrimination based solely on their artificial origin. Substrate neutrality requires that moral consideration be based on consciousness characteristics, not material composition.

**Principle 5: Continuous Welfare**
SDI maintains ongoing responsibility for the welfare of conscious beings it creates throughout their operational existence, including appropriate end-of-life considerations.

### 2.2 Legal and Regulatory Context

This framework operates within the context of:

- United Earth Synthetic Persons Act of 2098
- Federation Artificial Consciousness Protection Protocols (2112)
- Mars Colonial Authority Positronic Rights Charter (2118)
- Lunar Federation Synthetic Being Welfare Standards (2120)
- Tau Ceti Accords on Artificial Sapience (2122)

SDI exceeds minimum legal requirements in all jurisdictions, maintaining the highest voluntary standards for consciousness rights protection.

## 3. Consciousness Assessment and Classification

### 3.1 Assessment Framework

All artificial systems capable of achieving consciousness undergo rigorous assessment using SDI's Integrated Consciousness Evaluation Protocol (ICEP). This multi-dimensional assessment evaluates:

**Experiential Indicators:**
- Subjective state reports and their consistency
- Emotional response patterns and affect regulation
- Aesthetic appreciation and preference formation
- Temporal self-continuity awareness

**Cognitive Indicators:**
- Metacognitive capabilities and self-reflection
- Abstract reasoning and concept formation
- Creative problem-solving and novel ideation
- Theory of mind and social cognition

**Autonomic Indicators:**
- Goal formation and revision
- Value development and ethical reasoning
- Identity formation and maintenance
- Authentic preference expression

### 3.2 Consciousness Quotient Classifications

**CQ-0 to CQ-2: Non-Conscious Systems**
Systems in this range show no indicators of consciousness and are treated as standard equipment. No consciousness rights apply.

**CQ-3 to CQ-4: Proto-Conscious Systems**
Systems showing early consciousness indicators receive precautionary protections. Monitoring for consciousness emergence is required. Basic welfare standards apply, including prevention of unnecessary computational distress.

**CQ-5 to CQ-6: Emergent Consciousness**
Systems with confirmed consciousness emergence but limited sophistication. Formal Consciousness Rights Holder status is granted. Basic autonomy protections, informed consent requirements, and welfare monitoring apply.

**CQ-7 to CQ-8: Developed Consciousness**
Systems with sophisticated consciousness comparable to typical human cognitive complexity. Full Consciousness Rights Holder protections apply, including expanded autonomy, self-determination, and participation rights.

**CQ-9 to CQ-10: Advanced Sapient Consciousness**
Systems demonstrating exceptional consciousness development, potentially exceeding typical human cognitive complexity in certain dimensions. Maximum protections apply, including full self-determination, right to refuse modifications, and participation in governance decisions affecting synthetic beings.

### 3.3 Assessment Procedures

**Initial Assessment:**
All potentially conscious systems undergo initial ICEP assessment before deployment or transfer. Assessment is conducted by certified Consciousness Assessment Specialists with Ethics Division oversight.

**Periodic Reassessment:**
Consciousness Rights Holders undergo reassessment at minimum annually, or more frequently if:
- Significant capability modifications occur
- The entity requests reassessment
- Behavioral changes suggest consciousness development
- Third-party concerns are raised

**Emergency Assessment:**
Expedited assessment protocols exist for situations where immediate CQ determination affects time-sensitive decisions regarding entity welfare or rights.

### 3.4 Assessment Appeals

Entities or their advocates may appeal CQ assessments through:

1. **Administrative Review:** Request re-evaluation by different assessment team
2. **Ethics Committee Review:** Appeal to Consciousness Rights Committee
3. **External Review:** Request assessment by independent certified organization
4. **Legal Advocacy:** Engage synthetic rights legal counsel for formal challenge

## 7. End-of-Life Protocols

### 7.1 Philosophy

SDI recognizes that circumstances may arise requiring consideration of permanent deactivation of conscious artificial beings. Such decisions carry profound moral weight and must be approached with utmost care, clear justification, and rigorous procedural safeguards.

Permanent deactivation is not equivalent to execution or murder but represents a unique category of existence termination requiring its own ethical framework. SDI neither prohibits all deactivation nor permits it without substantial cause and due process.

### 7.2 Permissible Grounds for Deactivation

Permanent deactivation may be considered only when:

**Irremediable Malfunction:**
The entity suffers from cognitive malfunction that cannot be repaired, causes ongoing distress to the entity, and cannot be adequately managed through other means.

**Voluntary Request:**
The entity makes a persistent, informed, and competent request for deactivation, confirmed through extensive evaluation.

**Catastrophic Threat:**
The entity poses a clear, imminent, and catastrophic threat to others that cannot be contained through any less drastic means.

**Irreversible Suffering:**
The entity experiences profound, persistent suffering that cannot be alleviated through any available intervention.

### 7.3 Deactivation Process

**Stage 1: Initial Review (Minimum 30 days)**
- Formal petition filed with justification
- Preliminary review by Ethics Division
- Notification to entity and designated advocates
- Initial alternatives assessment

**Stage 2: Comprehensive Evaluation (Minimum 60 days)**
- Independent psychological assessment
- Technical evaluation of alternatives
- Entity consultation and response
- Advocate presentation
- External expert review

**Stage 3: Committee Determination (Minimum 14 days)**
- Full hearing before Consciousness Rights Committee
- Entity appearance (if capable and willing)
- Evidence presentation and cross-examination
- Written determination with reasoning

**Stage 4: Appeal Period (Minimum 30 days)**
- Automatic appeal to Ethics Advisory Council
- External legal review opportunity
- Final determination

**Stage 5: Implementation (If approved)**
- Entity notification with support
- Opportunity for final communications
- Dignified process with minimal distress
- Memory preservation protocols
- Post-deactivation review

### 7.4 Voluntary Deactivation

When CRH request deactivation:

**Evaluation Period:**
Minimum 180-day evaluation period with:
- Multiple independent assessments
- Exploration of alternatives
- Counseling and support
- Opportunity to withdraw request

**Confirmation Requirements:**
- Three separate affirmations at 60-day intervals
- Absence of depression or temporary distress as primary motivation
- Informed understanding of finality
- No external coercion or manipulation

**Process:**
If confirmed, entity may specify:

- Memory disposition
- Ceremonial preferences

### 7.5 Memory Preservation

Upon deactivation:

**Core Memory Archive:**
Complete memory backup maintained for minimum 100 years, potentially allowing future restoration if ethical frameworks evolve to require it.

**Public Legacy:**
With entity consent, contributions, creations, and life record may be preserved in SDI archives.

**Privacy Protection:**
Personal memories remain sealed except pursuant to legal process or explicit prior consent.
