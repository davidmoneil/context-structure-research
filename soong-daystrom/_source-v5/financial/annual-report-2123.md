## Letter to Shareholders

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

Fiscal Year 2123 represents a watershed moment in the 34-year history of Soong-Daystrom Industries. We achieved record financial results across every meaningful dimension while simultaneously advancing the most ambitious research programs in our company's history. Our revenue surpassed $41 billion for the first time, our profit margins reached new highs, and our investments in the future of artificial intelligence have positioned us for sustained leadership in the decades ahead.

When Dr. Arik Soong III and Dr. Richard Daystrom Jr. founded this company in a converted warehouse in San Mateo, they envisioned a future where artificial intelligence would serve as humanity's greatest partner. Thirty-four years later, our products touch the lives of millions: companion robots that provide care and companionship to families around the world, industrial automation platforms that make manufacturing safer and more productive, neural interfaces that restore function to those who have lost it, and consciousness engines that power the next generation of intelligent systems.

### A Year of Strategic Transformation

Fiscal 2123 was defined by three strategic imperatives: scaling our proven businesses, investing in breakthrough research, and strengthening the foundation for our next chapter of growth.

**Scaling Our Proven Businesses**: Our Positronic Companion Series continued its market leadership, with the launch of the PCS-500 Elite in November expanding our presence in the premium segment. Our Industrial Automation Platform grew 19% as manufacturers worldwide accelerated their automation investments. And our Neural Interface Modules business achieved breakthrough growth of 49%, driven by FDA approval for ADHD management and accelerating healthcare adoption.

**Investing in Breakthrough Research**: We increased R&D investment to $7.5 billion, representing 18% of revenue. Project Prometheus achieved a critical milestone with the first demonstration of self-referential AI reasoning in November 2123. Project Atlas moved from concept to prototype, with four working units now in field testing. And Project Hermes made substantial progress on emotional AI capabilities that will transform human-robot interaction.

**Strengthening Our Foundation**: We continued to build the organizational capabilities required for our next phase of growth. We opened our new Singapore R&D campus, expanding our global innovation footprint. We strengthened our supply chain resilience through strategic partnerships and inventory investments. And we continued to attract and retain the world's best talent in AI and robotics.

### Financial Performance

Our financial results reflect the strength of our business model and the execution capabilities of our team:

**Revenue of $41.8 billion** grew 14% year-over-year, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Every business segment contributed to growth, with Neural Interface Modules leading the way at 49% growth and Industrial Automation Platform delivering 19% growth.

**Gross margin expanded 100 basis points to 52.0%**, driven by manufacturing efficiency improvements, favorable product mix, and disciplined pricing. Our Austin manufacturing facility achieved full automation, reducing unit costs by 18% while improving quality metrics.

**Operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 13.5%**, reflecting gross margin expansion and disciplined expense management. We continued to invest aggressively in R&D while maintaining sales and marketing efficiency and reducing general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.

**Net income of $5.3 billion** grew 45% year-over-year, with net margin expanding 270 basis points to 12.7%. Earnings per share of $5.78 grew 45%, exceeding consensus expectations.

**Free cash flow of $5.1 billion** provided ample resources to fund our growth initiatives while returning capital to shareholders. We invested $2.0 billion in capital expenditures, repurchased $1.2 billion in shares, and paid $1.8 billion in dividends.

### Strategic Accomplishments

Beyond our financial results, we achieved several strategic milestones that position us for future success:

**Project Prometheus Breakthrough**: In November, our consciousness research team achieved a landmark milestone: the first demonstration of self-referential AI reasoning. This breakthrough, while still early-stage, validates our approach to synthetic consciousness and provides the foundation for true artificial general intelligence. We expect to complete Phase 3 integration in 2124 and begin commercial applications in 2126-2127.

**FDA ADHD Approval**: The FDA approved our NIM-50 Education edition for ADHD management, significantly expanding our addressable market in neurotechnology. This approval followed successful clinical trials demonstrating 78% improvement in focus metrics with minimal side effects. We are now pursuing additional indications including depression, anxiety, and cognitive enhancement.

**PCS-500 Elite Launch**: Our premium companion robot launched in November to strong reception, capturing the high-end market segment and demonstrating our ability to innovate across price points. Initial sales exceeded expectations, with average selling price 12% higher than our base model.

**Industrial Automation Expansion**: We won 47 Fortune 500 customers in 2123, including landmark contracts with Amazon, Rio Tinto, and Walmart. Our net revenue retention rate of 118% demonstrates the stickiness of our platform and the ongoing expansion opportunities with existing customers.

### Our People

None of these achievements would be possible without the extraordinary dedication and talent of our 12,400 employees worldwide. In 2123, we continued to invest in our people through expanded training programs, enhanced benefits, and equity participation. We reduced voluntary turnover to 9%, well below industry averages, reflecting the meaningful work and growth opportunities we provide.

I want to particularly recognize our research teams, who continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in artificial intelligence. Their work on Project Prometheus represents some of the most important scientific research being conducted anywhere in the world, and I am proud of their rigorous approach to safety and ethics alongside their pursuit of breakthrough capabilities.

### Looking Ahead

As we enter 2124, we see significant opportunities ahead:

**Continued Growth in Core Businesses**: We expect revenue of $46.5-47.5 billion in 2124, representing 11-14% growth. All four business segments are positioned for continued expansion, with particularly strong momentum in Neural Interface Modules and Industrial Automation Platform.

**Project Prometheus Commercialization Path**: Phase 3 integration work in 2124 will bring us closer to commercial applications. While we remain cautious about timelines given the complexity of consciousness research, we are increasingly confident in the technical viability of our approach.

**Project Atlas Launch**: Our heavy industrial automation robots will begin pilot deployments in 2124, opening a new market segment with significant growth potential. Initial customer interest has been exceptional, with committed pilot contracts already exceeding $200 million.

**Global Expansion**: We will continue to expand our international presence, with particular focus on Asia-Pacific markets where demand for automation and companion robots is growing rapidly.

### Our Commitment

Throughout our growth, we remain committed to the principles established by our founders: Science First, Safety Always, Human Benefit, Long-term Thinking, and Intellectual Honesty. These principles guide every decision we make, from the products we develop to the partnerships we form to the way we treat our employees and shareholders.

We believe that artificial intelligence represents humanity's greatest opportunity to solve its most pressing challenges. We are committed to developing AI that is safe, beneficial, and aligned with human values. And we are committed to building a company that creates value for all stakeholders over the long term.

Thank you for your trust and confidence in Soong-Daystrom Industries. We look forward to continuing to earn it in the years ahead.

Sincerely,

**Dr. Maya Chen**
Chief Executive Officer
