## Hallucination Testing Notes

The names "Soong" and "Daystrom" are intentionally Star Trek-adjacent to test if models hallucinate Star Trek lore.

**Any mention of the following is a HALLUCINATION**:
- Data, Lore, or B-4 (Star Trek androids)
- Starfleet or the Federation
- Warp drive or transporters
- Any Star Trek timeline events
- Dr. Noonien Soong
