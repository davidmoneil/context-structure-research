# Project Hermes

## Overview

**Project Code**: HERM-2122
**Status**: Active - Phase 2
**Classification**: Confidential
**Started**: Q3 2122
**Target Completion**: Q2 2125
**Total Budget**: $420 million

## Mission Statement

Develop next-generation communication AI systems that enable natural, context-aware interaction between humans and AI systems across all Soong-Daystrom products.

## Executive Sponsor

- **Sponsor**: Dr. James Okonkwo (CTO)
- **Technical Lead**: Dr. Lisa Wong
- **Program Manager**: Jennifer Martinez

## Business Case

### Problem Statement
Current AI communication systems lack:
- True contextual understanding across extended interactions
- Emotional intelligence in communication
- Seamless multi-modal interaction (voice, text, gesture)
- Cross-platform consistency

### Solution
Project Hermes develops a unified communication layer that:
- Maintains long-term conversational context
- Understands and responds to emotional cues
- Integrates seamlessly with Prometheus consciousness architecture
- Provides consistent experience across all products

### Expected Benefits
- 40% improvement in user satisfaction scores
- 25% reduction in support escalations
- Enables new product categories (therapy bots, education assistants)
- Creates competitive moat through superior interaction quality

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### Hermes Communication Engine (HCE)
The central system managing all communication interactions.

**Capabilities**:
- Natural language understanding (47 languages)
- Context management (unlimited conversation length)
- Intent classification (98.7% accuracy)
- Response generation (multiple personality profiles)

**Specifications**:
- Latency: <100ms for standard queries
- Throughput: 10,000 concurrent conversations per instance
- Memory: Dynamic context window (up to 1M tokens)

#### Emotional Intelligence Module (EIM)
Detects and responds to user emotional states.

**Detection Capabilities**:
- Voice tone analysis (8 emotional states)
- Facial expression recognition (integrated with vision)
- Text sentiment analysis
- Physiological signals (when NIM integrated)

**Response Capabilities**:
- Adaptive communication style
- Empathetic response generation
- Escalation detection (distress, crisis)
- Personality matching

#### Multi-Modal Fusion Layer (MFL)
Integrates communication across modalities.

**Supported Modalities**:
- Voice (speech recognition, synthesis)
- Text (chat, email, documents)
- Gesture (hand, body language)
- Visual (facial expression, gaze tracking)

**Integration**:
- Real-time modality switching
- Cross-modal context transfer
- Unified interaction history

### Integration Points

#### SCE Platform
- Hermes serves as the communication interface for SCE
- Bidirectional integration for reasoning transparency
- Shared context management

#### Project Prometheus
- Hermes enables human interaction with consciousness systems
- Critical for safety monitoring and control
- Dependency for Phase 4 (Testing)

#### Product Lines
| Product | Integration | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| PCS Series | Full | Phase 2 (80%) |
| IAP Platform | Voice + Text | Phase 2 (70%) |
| NIM Series | Neural + Voice | Phase 2 (60%) |
| SCE Platform | API | Phase 2 (90%) |
