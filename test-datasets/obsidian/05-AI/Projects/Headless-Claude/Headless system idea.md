It's part of it running in headless mode.I can imagine that it might want to reach out to me for a question.If something's critical, and that would include giving it access in headless mode to something like telegram.

As I think that through, if it asks me for something and I don't get back to it, it should have a way to add that task.To a queue and then close that session out.
Benefit fires up on the next session. If it runs headless every thirty minutes, it will detect the queue and pick up where it left off before it executes it again.

Or I can see that there are headless modes that run with certain personas for tasks or workflows, and when the maintenance check runs, it could run against the queue for that persona.To pick that task back up if it gets an answer from me.In the meantime. 

So there would need to be a way to ask a question. And listen for a response, capture it. And allow it to safely wait without burning tokens or processing power. 

We'd almost need a way to orchestrate it against tasks. Et cetera from the bead reference. 

I can almost imagine the possibility of a system that could even be designed to review working in ongoing tasks. And make decisions based on the existing design parameters. And if you might need to build a user persona for automated tasks for anticipating what's approved and not approved. Like a modified permission's
