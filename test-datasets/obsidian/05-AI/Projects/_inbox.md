# Response Inbox

Your standard location for responding to Claude's questions.

---

## How This Works

1. Claude creates a question and tells you to respond here
2. You write your response below in "Current Response"
3. Link back to the question you're answering
4. Tell Claude "I've responded" or "check inbox"
5. **Claude will**:
   - Copy your full response to the session folder (exact text, no summarization)
   - Move your response to "Previous Responses" below
   - Clear this section for next use

---

## Current Response

> **Responding to**: <!-- Link to question, e.g., [[2026/01/02-topic/questions/q1-name]] -->
> **Date**: <!-- YYYY-MM-DD -->

<!--
Write your response here. Use rich formatting:
- Tables
- Bullet lists
- Numbered lists
- Headers
- Code blocks
- Whatever helps communicate clearly

Claude will copy this EXACTLY to the session folder.
