## Title Cleanup Suggestions

These titles have author name or redundant info that could be cleaned:

| Current | Suggested |
|---------|-----------|
| Brandon Sanderson - Mistborn 01 - The Final Empire | The Final Empire |
| Brandon Sanderson - Mistborn 02 - Well of Ascension | The Well of Ascension |
| Brandon Sanderson - Mistborn 03 - The Hero of Ages | The Hero of Ages |
| Brandon Sanderson - Mistborn 04 - The Alloy of Law | The Alloy of Law |
| Words of Radiance - Brandon Sanderson (Unabridged) | Words of Radiance |
| Cytonic: Skyward, Book 3 | Cytonic |
| Dawnshard (Unabridged) | (DELETE - duplicate) |
| Warbreaker (Unabridged) | Warbreaker |

---

## Folder Structure Issue

There's a typo in the folder path:
- `/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/Brand Sanderson - Skyward/` (missing 'on')
- Should be: `/audiobooks/Brandon Sanderson/Skyward/`

This contains Cytonic but Skyward/Starsight are elsewhere.

---

## Recommended Actions

1. **Delete split files** (2 items)
2. **Delete duplicate Dawnshard** (keep the one in Stormlight Archives/)
3. **Apply series metadata** to all 42 remaining books
4. **Clean up titles** (remove author names from titles)
5. **Acquire missing Stormlight books** (Way of Kings, Oathbringer, Rhythm of War)
