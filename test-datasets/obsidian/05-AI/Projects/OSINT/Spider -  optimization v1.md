Answer to the questions 
### One 
Goal - 
- Attack Surface discovery - finding all of the infrastructure owned by an organization 
- There is an end goal of identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations like in S3 buckets 
- I do want to attempt to finger print the infratructure to understand what it is 
- I want this to focus on things that are highly confident belong to the primary organization that hosts the target domain 

#### Not a goal of phase 1 
- Affiliated infrastructure 
- third party / neighbors infrastructure 
- Full OSINT 
- Discovery of leaked credentials 



### Two 
Its more important that its completeness vs speed 
- I will wait, but I want to make sure its only focused on the things above. 
- I would like to start exploring it.... I almost think of it kinnda like maltego.. in that I will want to span and kick of things after the initial phase. 

### Three 
I have what is already configured I have VirusTotal and some others.  <-- let me know if there is anything else I should focus on... I want to keep it free. 
- If I need to use another module to do other scans (considering we are building a pipeline for recon)

### Four 
- ANswer is D all three, as I wont know what the hosting site is. I will want to dynamically expand this based on the hsots 

### Five 
- I think it's Option A, with maybe some configurability. 

Can we run both and see which one is better? using spiderfoot or the cloud_enum? Unless their is some additional mateirals online comparing them?
