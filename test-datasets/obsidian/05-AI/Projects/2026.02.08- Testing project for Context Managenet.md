I was thinking, as we build out a dynamic content management system that operates something like a graph database and then each piece of context like the input text the response or research will have to come up with a full list of what that is would get a configuration and including in that configuration could be as an example if I gave an input with one subject and one ask, it might have a spread of 0.1, but if I gave an input that asked five questions, the spread might equal 0.7. And then it would get a version and rank.


Every time the system input context, it would dynamically check each data point as described above and determine the relevance hop based on the context spread to determine how to load data. It would also include the size of the data in the configuration.

This would potentially allow it to say if all context totaling is less than the context window and the expected output just load all context

But if I’ll context is greater use some math formulas to calculate the distance of everything number of hops and only provide 1 to 3 hops depending on the question depth require required
And then it would provide a strategy to say if a file has an importance rating that’s high enough for the question it would determine the load strategy get part of the context, chunk it and only provide what’s relevant with a summary or provide the whole fil

The goal of this would be to have a good strategy for dynamically, providing content within the context window that allows it to keep as much understanding as possible, with the idea that it could go back and ask to reload for more context if it’s referenceable and knows that it exist and needs it to make a decision .

Well context windows are getting bigger. There could be a strategy here where you optimize for the least amount of context sent that’s relevant. 

This might mean that instead of keeping log data loaded a system you have the raw data in a context file and maybe you only pull the results of that load. Excuse me the This might mean that instead of keeping log data loaded a system you have the raw data in a context file and maybe you only pull the results of that load. Excuse me the results of the analysis of the log data and so if you ask a question related to the log data. It would load the relevant analysis and not the Raw data as the Raw data would be a half or two away from the other data analysis
