# Clarification Pattern for Complex Requests

**When receiving complex or ambiguous requests, STOP and clarify before implementing.**

## When to Trigger (Complexity Indicators)

| Indicator | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Multiple distinct outcomes | "Build X and also set up Y" |
| Ambiguous scope | "Make the system better" |
| New capability being designed | "I want to be able to do X" |
| Architecture/design decisions | "How should we structure..." |
| User explicitly asks for planning | "Help me think through..." |
| Request spans multiple systems | "Connect A to B to C" |
| Unclear deliverable | What artifact am I producing? |

## Before Starting, Consider

1. **Ask Questions**: Clarify requirements, scope, constraints
2. **Use Agents**: For complex autonomous tasks (`/agent deep-research`, `/agent service-troubleshooter`)
3. **Use Skills**: For guided multi-step workflows (`/plan`, `/parallel-dev:plan`)
4. **Check Patterns**: Is there an existing pattern? (`.claude/context/patterns/`)
5. **Apply Capability Layering**: Can this be scripted? (`patterns/capability-layering-pattern.md`)

## Response Template

```
I want to make sure I understand the ask and deliverable clearly.

**My understanding**: [restate what you think they want]

**Questions**:
1. [Clarifying question about scope]
2. [Clarifying question about deliverable]
3. [Clarifying question about constraints]

**Suggested approach**: [Agent/Skill/Pattern to use]

Does this make sense?
```

## Simple Requests (Skip Clarification)

- Single, clear action: "Run the health check"
- Explicit deliverable: "Create a script that does X"
- Continuation of existing work: "Continue with the plan"
- Information lookup: "What does X do?"
