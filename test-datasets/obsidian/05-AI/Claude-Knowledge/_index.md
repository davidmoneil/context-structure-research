# Claude Knowledge Base

Knowledge generated by Claude Code sessions, automatically synced from AIProjects.

**Source**: `AIProjects/.claude/agent-output/`, `knowledge/notes/`, `.claude/context/patterns/`
**Sync**: Runs at session end via `sync-knowledge-to-obsidian.sh`
**Direction**: One-way (AIProjects → Obsidian). Originals stay in AIProjects.

## Folders

| `patterns/` | `.claude/context/patterns/` | Architectural patterns and workflows (full archive) |
