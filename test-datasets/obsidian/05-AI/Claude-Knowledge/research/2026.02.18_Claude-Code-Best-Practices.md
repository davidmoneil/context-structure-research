# Deep Research: Claude Code Best Practices

**Research Date**: 2026-02-18
**Confidence Level**: High (15+ sources, multiple official Anthropic sources cross-referenced)
**Sources Consulted**: 22

---

## Executive Summary

Claude Code's effectiveness is fundamentally governed by context window management. Every best practice converges on one principle: **maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in the context window**. The 200K token context window sounds large but fills fast -- a single debugging session can consume tens of thousands of tokens. Official Anthropic guidance, community experience, and production case studies all confirm that concise, well-structured CLAUDE.md files (under 300 lines), progressive disclosure of information, deterministic tooling for repetitive tasks, and disciplined session management are the highest-leverage optimizations.

The research reveals a clear maturity curve: novice users create bloated CLAUDE.md files and rely on single long sessions; experienced users modularize instructions, use hooks for enforcement, leverage progressive disclosure through skills, and aggressively manage context through `/clear` and `/compact`.

## 1. CLAUDE.md File Best Practices

### 1.1 Size Recommendations

| Source | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| [HumanLayer Blog](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md) | Their root CLAUDE.md is under 60 lines |
| Community consensus | Under 300 lines performs best |
| [GitHub Issue #2766](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/2766) | Warning triggers for large files; keep under 50KB |
| [Instruction limit research](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/claude-md-supremacy/) | Frontier LLMs follow ~150-200 instructions consistently; Claude Code system prompt uses ~50, leaving ~100-150 for your CLAUDE.md |
| [Steve Kinney course](https://stevekinney.com/courses/ai-development/claude-dot-md) | Keep under 200 lines for main file; front-load critical rules |
| Token recommendation | Keep under 5K tokens (ideal) |

**Key insight**: There is no official hard limit from Anthropic, but the research converges on: **the shorter, the better**. Every unnecessary line degrades instruction-following on the remaining lines.

### 1.2 What to Include

Based on the [official Anthropic best practices blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) and [official Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices):

1. **Project map** -- What the codebase does, tech stack, key architecture decisions. Critical for monorepos: list apps, shared packages, and what everything is for.
2. **Behavioral rules** -- Only rules Claude would otherwise violate (e.g., "always use TypeScript strict mode", "never modify test files directly").
3. **Common commands** -- Build, test, lint commands that Claude needs to run.
4. **Repository conventions** -- Naming patterns, file organization conventions.
5. **Compaction instructions** -- What to preserve during `/compact` (e.g., "When compacting, always preserve the full list of modified files and any test commands").

### 1.3 What to EXCLUDE

From [HumanLayer](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md) and [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices):

1. **Code style guidelines** -- "Never send an LLM to do a linter's job." Use hooks + linters instead. Code style instructions add irrelevant context and degrade performance.
2. **Things Claude already does correctly** -- For each line, ask "Would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?" If not, cut it.
3. **Verbose examples** -- Put detailed examples in separate files referenced via `@path/to/file`.
4. **Information that's only relevant sometimes** -- Use progressive disclosure; put it in separate files.
5. **Redundant information** -- If it's in your package.json, tsconfig, or other config files Claude can read, don't duplicate it.

### 1.4 Structure Pattern (Recommended)

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description (1-2 sentences)

## Architecture
- Key components and their relationships
- @path/to/architecture-details.md (for deep dives)

## Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm test`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Conventions
- [Only rules Claude would otherwise violate]

## Compaction Instructions
- When compacting, preserve: [critical context items]
```

### 1.5 Anti-Pattern: The Bloated CLAUDE.md

The "over-specified CLAUDE.md" is the most common anti-pattern ([source](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md)). Symptoms:
- Claude ignores instructions because important rules get lost in noise
- Performance degrades as context fills with low-value instructions
- Instructions that duplicate what linters/formatters already enforce
- Verbose code examples embedded inline

**Fix**: Ruthlessly prune. Convert enforcement rules to hooks. Move detailed docs to separate files with `@` references.

---

## 2. Instruction Layering and Memory Hierarchy

### 2.1 Precedence Order

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory), the loading and precedence order:

```
managed > local > project > user
```

More specifically:
1. Enterprise CLAUDE.md (highest priority)
2. Project CLAUDE.md (in repo root)
3. Subdirectory CLAUDE.md files (loaded on-demand when working in that directory)
4. User ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (lowest priority for conflicts)

**Key rule**: More specific instructions take precedence over broader ones. Project CLAUDE.md overrides user CLAUDE.md on conflicts.

### 2.2 File Types and Roles

| File | Purpose | Visibility |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project instructions (checked into git) | Team-shared |
| `CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal project preferences (auto-gitignored) | Private |
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-global preferences | Private |
| Auto-memory | Notes Claude writes for itself during sessions | Private |

### 2.3 Monorepo Strategy

Place CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels ([official guidance](https://claude.com/blog/using-claude-md-files)):

```
root/CLAUDE.md           # Loaded always
root/api/CLAUDE.md       # Loaded when working in /api
root/packages/ui/CLAUDE.md  # Loaded when working in /packages/ui
```

Child directory CLAUDE.md files load **on-demand** when Claude reads files in those directories. This is ideal for monorepos with distinct modules.

### 2.4 Modular Context with @ References

CLAUDE.md can import additional files using `@path/to/file` syntax ([source](https://mcpcat.io/guides/reference-other-files/)). This enables:
- Keeping the main CLAUDE.md concise
- Progressive disclosure of detailed documentation
- Modular knowledge base without context bloat

Example:
```markdown
## Architecture
See @docs/architecture.md for full system design
See @docs/api-patterns.md for API conventions
```

Claude pulls in referenced content when relevant, not upfront.

---

## 3. Context Management and Token Efficiency

### 3.1 Context Window Allocation

From multiple sources ([ClaudeLog](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/context-window-depletion/), [claudefa.st](https://claudefa.st/blog/guide/mechanics/context-management)):

- Total context: 200K tokens
- System prompt + CLAUDE.md: ~20K tokens baseline (10%)
- MCP tool definitions: Variable (can be 40-80K if unmanaged)
- Usable working space: ~140-150K tokens
- **Performance degrades significantly in the final 20% of context** (80-100% fill)

### 3.2 Auto-Compaction Behavior

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/costs) and [hyperdev analysis](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/how-claude-code-got-better-by-protecting):

- Auto-compaction triggers when approaching ~95% of context capacity
- Claude Code has been progressively lowering the threshold to preserve more working memory
- Compaction summarizes conversation history, freeing ~50% of context
- Custom compaction instructions can be set in CLAUDE.md or via `/compact [focus]`
- CLAUDE.md content is NOT compacted -- it persists across compactions

### 3.3 Session Management Strategies

From [Richard Porter](https://richardporter.dev/blog/claude-code-token-management) and [Steve Kinney](https://stevekinney.com/courses/ai-development/cost-management):

| Strategy | When to Use | Token Savings |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `/clear` | Switching to unrelated task; after completing milestone; context > 20 iterations | Full reset |
| `/compact` | Approaching 75% context; Claude losing track; want to preserve key decisions | ~50% recovery |
| `/compact [focus]` | Need to preserve specific context (e.g., "focus on API changes") | ~50% + targeted |
| Fresh session | Complex tasks requiring clean reasoning | Full reset |

**Critical thresholds**:
- **70% context**: Consider manual compaction
- **75% context**: Actively decide what to preserve before compacting
- **30K tokens**: Keep complex work conversations under this for best results
- **50-70% savings**: Achievable just by using `/clear` between tasks + good CLAUDE.md

### 3.4 Compaction Instructions

Add to CLAUDE.md ([source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works)):

```markdown
## Compaction Instructions
When compacting, always preserve:
- Full list of modified files
- Test commands and their results
- Key architectural decisions made
- Current task status and next steps
```

### 3.5 Performance Degradation Pattern

From [multiple sources](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/how-claude-code-got-better-by-protecting):

- 20-30% performance degradation with accumulated context
- LLMs bias toward instructions at the **beginning** (system prompt, CLAUDE.md) and **end** (most recent messages)
- Middle context is most likely to be "forgotten" -- the "lost in the middle" effect
- Free context space isn't wasted -- it's where reasoning happens

---

## 4. Hooks System Best Practices

### 4.1 Hook Types and Use Cases

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide) and [disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery](https://github.com/disler/claude-code-hooks-mastery):

| Hook | Fires | Use Cases |
|------|-------|-----------|
| PreToolUse | Before tool execution | Validation, permission checks, input modification, blocking dangerous actions |
| PostToolUse | After tool execution | Auto-formatting, test running, logging, quality gates |
| Notification | On agent notifications | Session tracking, alerting |
| Stop | When Claude stops | Final validation, auto-formatting, summary generation |

### 4.2 Performance Implications

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide):

- **Command hooks**: Minimal overhead -- typically milliseconds
- **Prompt/Agent hooks**: Slower (they call the LLM); use timeouts
- **Multiple hooks**: When multiple hooks match an event, they run in **parallel**
- **Identical commands**: Automatically deduplicated
- **Key principle**: Use a single entry point with intelligent command routing to avoid performance penalties

### 4.3 PreToolUse Input Modification (v2.0.10+)

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks-guide):

Starting in v2.0.10, PreToolUse hooks can modify tool inputs before execution:
- Intercept tool calls and modify JSON input
- Enables: transparent sandboxing, automatic security enforcement, convention adherence
- **Must output valid JSON and preserve all required fields**

### 4.4 Exit Code Protocol

| Exit Code | Meaning | Behavior |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 0 | Success | Execution continues normally |
| 2 | Blocking error | Halts current action (critical for PreToolUse) |

### 4.5 Key Best Practice: Hooks > CLAUDE.md for Enforcement

From [HumanLayer](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md):

> "Unlike CLAUDE.md instructions which are advisory, hooks are deterministic and guarantee the action happens."

**Convert enforcement rules to hooks whenever possible:**
- Code formatting -> PostToolUse hook running formatter
- Lint checks -> Stop hook running linter
- File protection -> PreToolUse hook blocking writes to sensitive paths
- Commit conventions -> PreToolUse hook on git commit

### 4.6 Security Considerations

- Hooks run with your user credentials -- review scripts carefully
- Quote variables, validate inputs, avoid sensitive paths
- Use absolute paths in hook scripts
- Block writes to `.env`, production config, `/.git` using PreToolUse

---

## 5. Skills and Commands Architecture

### 5.1 Skills Architecture (Open Standard)

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) and [Anthropic announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills):

Skills replaced slash commands as the primary extension mechanism. The format is an open standard adopted by both Anthropic and OpenAI.

**SKILL.md structure:**
```markdown
---
description: "Brief description for Claude to match against"
# YAML frontmatter with metadata
---

# Skill Name

Instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked
```

### 5.2 Progressive Disclosure Model

Skills implement three-tier loading ([source](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)):

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): Loaded at startup into system prompt. Claude knows what's available.
2. **Full instructions** (<5K tokens): Loaded when Claude determines the skill applies.
3. **Bundled resources**: Files, scripts, references loaded only as needed.

This means you can install many skills without upfront context penalty.

### 5.3 Character Budget

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills):

- Skill description budget: **2% of context window**, with a fallback of **16,000 characters**
- At 200K context: ~4,000 characters for all skill descriptions combined
- Run `/context` to check if skills are being excluded due to budget
- **Keep skill descriptions short and keyword-rich**

### 5.4 SKILL.md Size Limits

- Keep main SKILL.md under **500 lines**
- For complex skills, split into separate files using progressive disclosure
- Use `references/` directory for detailed documentation
- Use `scripts/` directory for executable code

### 5.5 Directory Structure

```
.claude/skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md          # Core instructions (< 500 lines)
    references/       # Detailed docs loaded on-demand
      finance.md
      api-guide.md
    scripts/          # Executable scripts
      analyze.py
```

### 5.6 Skills vs Commands vs Subagents

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) and [community guides](https://alexop.dev/posts/understanding-claude-code-full-stack/):

| Feature | Skills | Commands (legacy) | Subagents |
|---------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Trigger | Natural language (auto) | Explicit `/command` | Delegated by Claude |
| Context | Progressive disclosure | Full load on invoke | Isolated context window |
| Use for | Multi-step workflows | Quick actions | Parallel work, large output isolation |
| Format | SKILL.md + resources | Single .md file | .md with YAML frontmatter |

---

## 6. MCP Server Configuration

### 6.1 Context Impact

From [Anthropic engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use) and [community reports](https://medium.com/@joe.njenga/claude-code-just-cut-mcp-context-bloat-by-46-9-51k-tokens-down-to-8-5k-with-new-tool-search-ddf9e905f734):

- MCP tool definitions can consume **40-80K+ tokens** if unmanaged
- One developer documented 66K tokens consumed before typing anything
- Another hit 82K tokens (41% of context) from MCP tools alone
- **Rule of thumb**: If you're using more than 20K tokens on MCPs, you're crippling Claude

### 6.2 MCP Tool Search (Automatic)

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) and [Anthropic engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use):

- Activates automatically when MCP tool descriptions exceed **10% of context window** (10K+ tokens)
- Tools marked with `defer_loading: true` are discovered on-demand
- **85% reduction** in token overhead (Anthropic's number)
- Real-world reports: 51K tokens down to 8.5K (46.9% reduction in one case), up to 95% in others
- Requires Sonnet 4+ or Opus 4+ (Haiku does not support tool search)

### 6.3 Configuration Hierarchy

```
local scope > project scope > user scope
```

- Use `.mcp.json` for project-scoped configuration (shared via git)
- Use environment variable expansion for secrets: `${API_KEY}`
- Never hardcode secrets in configuration files

### 6.4 MCP Loading Strategies

From research and [community patterns](https://scottspence.com/posts/optimising-mcp-server-context-usage-in-claude-code):

| Strategy | Description | Use Case |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Always-On | Server loads every session | Critical, frequently-used tools (filesystem, git) |
| On-Demand | Enabled per session | Specialized tools (Prometheus, n8n, SSH) |
| Selective toggling | CLI tools to enable/disable servers | Sessions with specific tool needs |

**Best practices:**
- Only enable MCP servers you're actively using in a session
- Write specific, keyword-rich tool descriptions (helps Tool Search)
- Use `server instructions` field to help Claude understand when to search for your tools
- Consider building "gateway" MCPs that bundle related tools under one server

---

## 7. Subagent and Agent Patterns

### 7.1 When to Use What

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) and [Amit Kothari's guide](https://amitkoth.com/claude-code-task-tool-vs-subagents/):

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| Direct tool use | Simple, single-step operations |
| Task tool | Parallel execution (up to 10 concurrent); context isolation needed |
| Subagents | Recurring specialized workflows; need tool restrictions; want reusable configurations |
| Agent teams | Sustained parallelism; work exceeds single context window |

### 7.2 Context Isolation Benefits

From [PubNub guide](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/best-practices-for-claude-code-sub-agents/):

The most effective use of subagents is **isolating operations that produce large output**:
- Running tests
- Fetching documentation
- Processing log files
- Code exploration

Verbose output stays in the subagent's context; only the summary returns to main conversation.

### 7.3 The "Handoff Problem"

From [community reports](https://www.ibuildwith.ai/blog/task-tool-vs-subagents-how-agents-work-in-claude-code/):

Subagents start with a blank slate. The main agent must provide a detailed brief. Without it, the subagent suffers "context amnesia" and produces generic output.

**Mitigation**: Write detailed delegation prompts. Include relevant file paths, context, and expected output format.

### 7.4 Critical Limitation

Subagents **cannot spawn other subagents**. This is by design. For nested delegation, use skills or chain subagents from the main conversation.

### 7.5 Subagent Configuration

Store in `.claude/agents/` as Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: "Code reviewer for TypeScript projects"
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---

# Code Reviewer

Review code for...
```

Key frontmatter fields: `description`, `prompt`, `tools`, `disallowedTools`, `model`, `permissionMode`, `mcpServers`, `hooks`, `maxTurns`, `skills`, `memory`.

---

## 8. Advanced Patterns from Power Users

### 8.1 Git Worktrees for Parallel Work

From [Anthropic's blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):

Git worktrees enable running multiple Claude sessions simultaneously on different branches:
- Each worktree has its own working directory with isolated files
- Shares the same Git history
- Perfect for: one Claude writing code while another writes tests, or parallel feature development

### 8.2 Headless Mode for Automation

From [Anthropic's blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):

- Powers automations triggered by GitHub events
- The Claude Code repository itself uses headless Claude to label incoming issues
- Useful for: CI/CD integration, issue triage, automated code review

### 8.3 Multi-Claude Verification

From [Anthropic's blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):

> "Have one Claude write tests, then have another Claude write code to make the tests pass."

This separation yields better results than single-Claude handling everything.

### 8.4 The /clear + /catchup Pattern

From [community](https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature):

1. `/clear` the state
2. Run a custom `/catchup` command that makes Claude read all changed files in the git branch
3. Results in clean context focused on current work

### 8.5 Context Hygiene Discipline

From [setec.rs case study](https://claude-blog.setec.rs/blog/claude-code-beast-hardcore-workflow) (300K lines rewritten in 6 months):

> "The consistent playbook is: start with hardened setup, engineer context deliberately (CLAUDE.md), scope sessions tightly, automate validation, and never let autonomy outrun your tests."

### 8.6 Plan Mode for Architecture

From [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices):

Claude Code Plan Mode (introduced June 2025) allows Claude to research, analyze, and create implementation plans without making code changes. Use it before implementation for:
- Architectural reviews
- Understanding existing code
- Planning multi-file changes

---

## 9. How Anthropic Teams Use Claude Code

From the [official PDF](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/58284b19e702b49db9302d5b6f135ad8871e7658.pdf) and [blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-anthropic-teams-use-claude-code):

### 9.1 Key Internal Findings

1. **Documentation quality correlates directly with Claude Code effectiveness** -- The Data Infrastructure team found Claude excelled at routine tasks when existing patterns were well-documented.
2. **3x speedup** on incident response (10-15 min tasks resolved in 3-5 min).
3. **80% reduction** in research time (1 hour -> 10-20 min).
4. **Cross-functional adoption**: Lawyers, marketers, data scientists all use Claude Code effectively.

### 9.2 Pattern: Context as Catalyst

Anthropic's internal teams treat CLAUDE.md as a replacement for traditional data catalogs and discoverability tools. The key insight: document **which files are relevant for which tasks** and **how data pipelines connect**.

---

## 10. Specific Recommendations for AIProjects

Based on this research and your current setup:

### 10.1 CLAUDE.md Size Audit

Your current CLAUDE.md is comprehensive but likely exceeds the 300-line recommendation significantly. Consider:
1. **Audit line count** -- if over 300 lines, the priority sections, workflow documentation, and detailed examples should move to separate files
2. **Apply the "Would removing this cause Claude to make mistakes?" test** to every section
3. **Move to progressive disclosure**: Keep the main CLAUDE.md as an index with `@` references

### 10.2 Hook-ify Enforcement Rules

Any rule in CLAUDE.md that says "always do X" or "never do Y" is a candidate for conversion to a hook. Hooks are deterministic; CLAUDE.md instructions are advisory.

### 10.3 MCP Loading

Your current MCP loading strategy (Always-On / On-Demand / Isolated) aligns well with the research findings. The key validation: with 7 active MCP servers, Tool Search should be handling context automatically.

### 10.4 Compaction Instructions

Add explicit compaction instructions to CLAUDE.md if not already present.

### 10.5 Session Discipline

The research strongly supports aggressive `/clear` usage between tasks. The `/checkpoint` + `/clear` pattern you already use aligns with best practices.

---

## Conflicting Information

| Topic | Source A | Source B | Assessment |
|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| CLAUDE.md ideal size | 60 lines (HumanLayer) | 300 lines (community consensus) | Both valid; depends on project complexity. Start minimal, add only what's needed. |
| Compaction threshold | 95% (auto-compact) | 70-75% (manual trigger recommended) | Not conflicting -- community recommends proactive compaction before auto-compact fires |
| Skills vs commands | "Commands merged into skills" (some sources) | Both still work in parallel | Skills are the future; legacy commands still functional but skills are preferred |
| MCP Tool Search savings | 46.9% (one report) | 85-95% (Anthropic + other reports) | Varies by setup. The 85% is Anthropic's official number; real-world varies. |

---

## Knowledge Gaps

1. **No official Anthropic number for ideal CLAUDE.md size** -- all numbers are community-derived
2. **Hook execution order** when multiple hooks match: documented as parallel, but no guarantee of ordering
3. **Memory auto-notes quality** -- limited guidance on when to trust vs. prune Claude's auto-memory
4. **Agent team coordination patterns** -- relatively new feature, limited production case studies
5. **Skills budget scaling formula** -- 2% of context window is documented but edge cases with many skills are not well-covered
