# Deep Research: Obsidian.md Updates and New Features (Early 2025 - February 2026)

**Research Date**: 2026-02-13
**Confidence Level**: High (official changelog and documentation sources confirmed across multiple queries)
**Sources Consulted**: 18+

## Executive Summary

Obsidian has progressed from v1.7 through v1.12.1 since early 2025, with four major feature milestones: (1) the **Web Viewer** core plugin in v1.8 (January 2025), (2) the **Bases** database system and new `.base` file format in v1.9 (May 2025), (3) the **Bases API** and enhanced views in v1.10 (October 2025), and (4) **Markdown links in properties**, **SecretStorage API**, and the official **Obsidian CLI** arriving in v1.11-1.12 (December 2025 - February 2026).

The most consequential change for anyone maintaining an Obsidian skill is the introduction of Bases -- a new core plugin with a new `.base` file format (YAML-based) that provides database-like views over vault files using properties/frontmatter as fields. Additionally, the deprecation of singular property names (`tag`, `alias`, `cssclass`) in v1.9 is a breaking change that requires migration.

## Key Findings

### 1. Bases: New Core Database Plugin (v1.9+)

**Impact: CRITICAL for skill maintenance**

Bases is the single biggest feature addition since Properties (v1.4). It introduces:

- **New `.base` file format**: YAML-based files that define database views over vault notes
- **Filter queries**: Boolean expressions using property comparisons (e.g., `taggedWith`, `linksTo`, operators)
- **Formula properties**: Computed fields using expressions, arithmetic, and built-in functions
- **Multiple view types**: Table (default), Card view, List view, Maps view (v1.10+)
- **Embeddable in notes**: Bases can be embedded in markdown notes via code blocks
- **All data backed by local Markdown**: Properties stored in YAML frontmatter serve as database fields

#### .base File Structure (YAML)

```yaml
# Key sections:
filters:    # Boolean filter expressions (AND/OR/NOT, comparison operators)
formulas:   # Computed properties (string-encoded formulas)
properties: # Configuration for each property display
views:      # One or more view definitions (table, card, list, map)
```

#### Bases Functions (updated significantly in v1.9.2)

- Array functions: `filter()`, `map()`, `reduce()`
- Summary formulas operate on the `values` variable (list of all values for a property)
- Comparison operators for numbers, dates, and equality checks
- Boolean operators for combining conditions
- **Note**: Functions were heavily reworked in v1.9.2 with breaking changes from initial v1.9.0

#### Bases API (v1.10+)

- Initial Bases API shipped in v1.10.0
- Plugin developers can build custom Bases views (docs at `docs.obsidian.md/plugins/guides/bases-view`)
- Custom functions through Bases API is listed as a future/planned feature
- **Bases search** added in v1.12

#### Bases Roadmap (from official docs)

Planned features include: more view types, enhanced plugin API, Publish support, and custom functions.

### 2. Properties/Frontmatter Changes

**Impact: BREAKING CHANGE in v1.9**

#### Deprecated Property Names (v1.9)

- `tag` -> `tags` (REQUIRED)
- `alias` -> `aliases` (REQUIRED)
- `cssclass` -> `cssclasses` (REQUIRED)
- Values MUST be lists, not text strings
- **Migration tool**: Format Converter core plugin has a new option to auto-fix these

#### Markdown Links in Properties (v1.11)

- Text and list properties now support standard Markdown links
- Internal links are automatically updated when destination files are moved/renamed
- External links in properties now open correctly in the browser
- **This was a highly requested feature** -- previously only wikilinks worked in properties

#### Global Properties Enhancements (v1.10)

- New ability to delete a property from ALL notes at once via Global Properties view
- List properties now allow duplicate values

### 3. Canvas Changes

**Impact: MODERATE -- incremental improvements, no format changes**

#### Canvas Backlinks and Graph Integration (2025)

- Backlinks in Canvas files are now detected and shown in the backlinks view
- Canvas links are now counted as links in the Graph view
- This was a longstanding community request

#### Web Embedding in Canvas (v1.8)

- Web Viewer plugin enables embedding web pages directly in canvas files

#### .canvas (JSON Canvas) File Format

- **No changes to the format specification** -- still at JSON Canvas v1.0
- The format was renamed to "JSON Canvas" with its own site (jsoncanvas.org) and MIT license
- The JSON Schema proposal (GitHub issue #10) remains open but unimplemented
- Community plugins (Advanced Canvas, Semantic Canvas, Enhanced Canvas) continue to extend functionality

### 4. New Core Plugins

#### Web Viewer (v1.8)

- Opens external links within Obsidian as tabs
- Configurable homepage, ad blocker, page saving
- Enables web page embedding in canvas files

#### Footnotes View (v1.9)

- Sidebar tab showing footnotes for the current file
- Editable footnote text in the viewer
- Outline view now highlights correctly with footnotes

### 5. Plugin API Changes

**Impact: HIGH for plugin developers**

#### SecretStorage API (v1.11)

- New `SecretStorage` and `SecretComponent` classes exposed
- Opt-in shared secret storage across plugins
- Use case: API keys (Google, OpenAI, etc.) shared between plugins
- Replaces per-plugin credential management with centralized approach

#### SettingGroup API (v1.11)

- New `SettingGroup` class for organizing plugin settings
- Logical groups with optional headers
- Provides standardized design language for settings UIs
- Note: Documentation is minimal; developers report examples are hard to find

#### Bases View API (v1.10)

- Plugin developers can build custom Bases views
- Official docs: `docs.obsidian.md/plugins/guides/bases-view`

#### Location API (v1.10+)

- Plugin developers can now request user location
- Used by the Maps view in Bases

#### Other API Changes

- Electron upgraded to v39.2.6 (Wayland default on Linux)
- Inter Variable font bundled (variable font weights)
- Background plugin update checks (configurable: every 3 days or after app updates)
- Cookie encryption added

### 6. Official Obsidian CLI (v1.12)

**Impact: HIGH for automation and integration**

- Official CLI tool (early access in v1.12)
- Commands include: open vault, open note, search, create note, daily note operations
- `daily:prepend` inserts content after frontmatter (not at file beginning)
- Vault parameter must be first argument if included
- Available on desktop platforms

### 7. Template System

**Impact: LOW -- no major changes to core Templates plugin**

- Core Templates plugin remains largely unchanged
- Templater community plugin updated to v2.18.1 (Feb 2026) with maintenance fixes
- New community plugin: Default Template (auto-applies template to new notes)
- New community plugin: Handlebars Dynamic Template (Handlebars syntax in notes)
- No new core template variables or format changes

### 8. Dataview Plugin Status

**Impact: MODERATE -- maintenance mode, coexistence with Bases**

- DataviewJS is now opt-in instead of opt-out (separate toggle for inline DataviewJS)
- New functions: `hash()` for consistent value generation, `slice()` for array slicing
- Inline fields now render explicitly in Live Preview
- New companion plugin: Dataview Autocompletion (real-time autocomplete for metadata fields)
- **Relationship to Bases**: Bases is the official/core alternative, but Dataview remains widely used and maintained

## Detailed Analysis: Impact on Obsidian Skill Maintenance

### Document CRUD

| Area | Change | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| File creation | CLI can now create notes externally | Consider CLI integration |
| File reading | No format changes | None |
| File deletion | Linked images can now auto-delete with file (v1.12) | Update deletion logic |
| Properties migration | Singular names deprecated | Update any `tag`/`alias`/`cssclass` handling |

### Frontmatter/Properties Queries

| Area | Change | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Markdown links in properties | New in v1.11 | Parse markdown links in text/list properties |
| Global property deletion | New in v1.10 | New capability to expose |
| Duplicate list values | New in v1.10 | Handle duplicate values in list properties |
| Singular property names | Removed in v1.9 | Migrate any `tag`/`alias`/`cssclass` references |

### Canvas File Operations

| Area | Change | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| .canvas format | No changes (still JSON Canvas v1.0) | None |
| Backlinks detection | Now works for canvas files | Leverage for link analysis |
| Web embeds in canvas | New via Web Viewer | Handle new embed types |
| Graph integration | Canvas links now counted | None (transparent) |

### Schema Detection

| Area | Change | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| `.base` file format | **NEW** -- YAML-based database views | Add `.base` file detection and parsing |
| Properties schema | Singular names removed | Update validation rules |
| Bases formulas | New computed property system | Consider formula awareness |

### Template Management

| Area | Change | Action Required |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Core Templates | No changes | None |
| Templater | Minor maintenance updates | None |
| Bases templates | `.base` files can serve as view templates | Consider `.base` template support |

## Best Practices

1. **Add `.base` file support immediately** -- this is the most significant new file format and will only grow in importance
2. **Migrate property name handling** -- ensure `tags`/`aliases`/`cssclasses` (plural) are used exclusively
3. **Handle Markdown links in properties** -- text and list properties can now contain `[text](path)` links
4. **Consider CLI integration** -- the official CLI provides programmatic vault access
5. **Watch the Bases API** -- it's evolving rapidly and will likely get custom function support
6. **Maintain Dataview compatibility** -- Dataview is still widely used alongside Bases

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Using singular property names** (`tag`, `alias`, `cssclass`) -- these no longer work in v1.9+
2. **Ignoring `.base` files in vault operations** -- they are first-class vault files now
3. **Assuming properties are plain text only** -- Markdown links are now valid in text/list properties
4. **Relying on old Bases formula syntax** -- heavy changes in v1.9.2 broke earlier formulas
5. **Not checking DataviewJS opt-in status** -- DataviewJS is now opt-in, not opt-out

## Conflicting Information

- **Canvas development pace**: Community sentiment says Canvas is "half-baked" and development has stalled, but official changelogs show incremental improvements (backlinks, graph integration, web embeds). The truth is likely that core Canvas format changes have stopped while integration improvements continue.
- **Bases vs Dataview**: Some sources suggest Bases will replace Dataview; others say they serve different purposes. The reality is Bases is the official core solution, but Dataview's query language remains more powerful for complex queries. Both will coexist for the foreseeable future.

## Knowledge Gaps

1. **Detailed Bases API type definitions** -- the full TypeScript API surface for Bases view plugins is not well documented yet
2. **CLI command exhaustive list** -- the official CLI documentation at help.obsidian.md/cli was not fully accessible; the complete command set may be broader than what was found
3. **v1.8 detailed changelog** -- specific API changes in v1.8 beyond Web Viewer were not fully enumerated
4. **Electron v39 impact** -- what specific renderer or API changes the Electron upgrade brings to plugin developers

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Add `.base` file format parsing and detection to the Obsidian skill
2. **Priority 2**: Update frontmatter handling for the v1.9 breaking changes (singular -> plural property names)
3. **Priority 3**: Add Markdown link awareness in property values
4. **Priority 4**: Explore CLI integration for programmatic vault operations
5. **Priority 5**: Monitor Bases API evolution for future view plugin capabilities
