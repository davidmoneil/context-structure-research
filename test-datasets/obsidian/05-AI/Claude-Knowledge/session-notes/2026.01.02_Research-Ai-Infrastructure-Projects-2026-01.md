# Research: AI Infrastructure Projects Comparison

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Purpose**: Compare similar GitHub projects to AIProjects and AIfred for improvement ideas
**Status**: Complete

---

## Executive Summary

Analyzed dozens of GitHub repositories for personal AI infrastructure management similar to AIProjects/AIfred. Found several standout projects with innovative approaches to Claude Code configuration, MCP integration, hook automation, agent orchestration, and knowledge management.

**Key Finding**: AIProjects is already sophisticated but missing several patterns that could significantly enhance capabilities:
- Self-evolution (auto-learning from corrections)
- Time-travel memory queries
- Swarm coordination for complex tasks
- Parallel session isolation via git worktrees
- Real-time agent monitoring

## Key Patterns to Implement

### 1. Self-Evolution Pattern
```
When user corrects Claude:
1. Detect correction phrase ("No, actually...", "That's wrong...")
2. Prompt: "Should I add this to lessons learned?"
3. If yes, update .claude/context/lessons/corrections.md
4. Optionally store in Memory MCP with CORRECTED_BELIEF relation
```

### 2. SessionStart Hook
```javascript
// .claude/hooks/session-start.js
export default async function(event) {
  const fs = require('fs');
  const sessionState = fs.readFileSync('.claude/context/session-state.md', 'utf8');
  // Parse status, last work, next steps
  // Return context injection for Claude
  return {
    continue: true,
    context: `Session context loaded: ${extractSummary(sessionState)}`
  };
}
```

### 3. Task Orchestration Commands
```
/orchestration:plan "Build authentication system"
→ Decomposes into subtasks with dependencies
→ Creates .claude/orchestration/auth-system.json

/orchestration:status
→ Shows task tree with completion percentages

/orchestration:resume
→ Restores full context after interruption

/orchestration:commit "Implemented login endpoint"
→ Links git commit to current orchestration task
```

### 4. Bi-Temporal Memory Schema
```
Entity fields:
- created_at: When first observed
- valid_from: When understanding became valid
- valid_until: When superseded (null if current)
- superseded_by: Link to newer entity

Enables:
- "What did I know about X in December 2025?"
- "How has my understanding of Y evolved?"
- "Show me deprecated patterns"
```
