# Session: Google Antigravity Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-11-24
**Status**: Investigated and Declined
**Decision**: Do not integrate Antigravity with Claude Code infrastructure

## Context

User discovered Google Antigravity (https://antigravity.google/), a new agentic development platform released November 2025, and wanted to explore integration with existing Claude Code infrastructure.

## What is Google Antigravity?

**Product Overview**:
- **Type**: Agentic development platform (VS Code fork)
- **Release**: November 2025 (public preview, free for individuals)
- **Models**: Multi-model support (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5, OpenAI GPT)
- **Architecture**: Agent-first with bifurcated interface (Editor + Agent Manager)
- **Key Feature**: Autonomous agents that plan, execute, and verify complex tasks across editor, terminal, and browser
- **Artifacts**: Agents generate verifiable deliverables (task lists, plans, screenshots, browser recordings)
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, Windows

**Installation**:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://us-central1-apt.pkg.dev/doc/repo-signing-key.gpg | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/antigravity-repo-key.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/antigravity-repo-key.gpg] https://us-central1-apt.pkg.dev/projects/antigravity-auto-updater-dev/ antigravity-debian main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/antigravity.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install antigravity
```

## Proposed Workflow (Rejected)

**User's Initial Idea**:
- Use Claude Code for infrastructure tasks (Docker, system management)
- Use Antigravity for coding tasks (API development, web modifications)
- Integrate them so Claude Code can access logs and send back to Antigravity

## Critical Analysis: Why This Doesn't Work

### Core Problem: No Real Integration

These are **two separate AI agents** with **separate contexts**. There's no API or protocol for them to communicate. The proposed workflow would require:

1. **Manual context switching**: Copy errors from Antigravity → paste to Claude Code → copy logs → paste back to Antigravity
2. **Duplicate explanations**: Both agents need full project context, infrastructure knowledge, preferences
3. **Lost context**: Antigravity doesn't know about n8n workflows, Docker setup, SSH hosts, MCP servers, or `.claude/context/` documentation

### What You'd Actually Experience

**Scenario: "Build a REST API"**

**With proposed multi-tool workflow**:
```
You → Antigravity: "Build a REST API for my n8n workflows"
Antigravity: "Here's the code. Deploy it to Docker."
You → Claude Code: "Deploy this API to Docker"
Claude Code: "What port? Dependencies? How does it connect to n8n?"
You: (re-explaining context Antigravity already knew)
Claude Code: "Build failed. PostgreSQL connection error."
You → Antigravity: (paste error logs)
Antigravity: "Fix the connection string"
You → Claude Code: "Apply this fix"
(repeat 5-10 times with manual copy/paste)
```

**With Claude Code alone (current)**:
```
You → Claude Code: "Build a REST API for my n8n workflows"
Claude Code: "I'll use your existing n8n MCP, check Docker network config, deploy with proper env vars"
(Already knows infrastructure, can check logs directly, iterate autonomously)
```

### When Multi-Tool Workflows Actually Work

✅ **Good multi-tool workflows** (distinct, non-overlapping capabilities):
- Photoshop (design) → Export → Claude Code (deployment)
- Tools do different things, handoff is clean (just files)

❌ **This proposed workflow**:
- Both tools write code
- Both can interact with Docker
- Both need full infrastructure context
- Handoff requires constant manual mediation

### The Real Cost

**Workflow fragmentation**: Trading integrated context for artificial task-type boundaries creates friction that kills productivity.

## Comparison: Claude Code vs Antigravity

| Feature | Claude Code (Current) | Google Antigravity |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Interface** | CLI-based in terminal | GUI-based (VS Code fork) |
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet 4.5 only | Multi-model (Gemini 3, Claude, GPT) |
| **Workflow** | Interactive conversation | Agent dispatching + artifacts |
| **Browser automation** | Via MCP (Playwright) | Built-in agent capability |
| **Integration** | Command-line first | IDE-first with terminal access |
| **Context** | Established (MCP servers, docs) | Would need to rebuild |
| **Infrastructure knowledge** | Full (Docker, n8n, SSH, paths) | None (would need explaining) |

## Decision: Do Not Integrate

**Reasoning**:
1. **No actual integration exists** - only manual mediation between two separate agents
2. **Claude Code already handles both infrastructure AND coding** - no capability gap identified
3. **High context-switching cost** for unclear benefits
4. **Existing investment in Claude Code ecosystem**: MCP servers, context documentation, workflows, slash commands, knowledge base
5. **User couldn't identify specific missing capability** that would justify the workflow fragmentation

## Better Alternatives (If Reconsidering Later)

### Option 1: Evaluate Antigravity Properly
- Install it for a **complete standalone project** (not integrated workflow)
- Build a small API from scratch entirely in Antigravity
- Compare speed/quality to doing the same thing in Claude Code
- Decide if visual interface/Gemini 3/artifacts provide real value

### Option 2: Use One Tool Per Project
```
Infrastructure tasks (Docker, n8n, system admin) → Claude Code
Full application development → Antigravity (or Claude Code)
```
**Don't mix tools on the same task** - pick one and commit.

### Option 3: Stick with Claude Code (Current Decision)
Current setup already provides:
- API development capability
- Web code modification
- Docker management
- Log access
- Full infrastructure context
- 7 active MCP servers
- Documented workflows and context

## Key Takeaway

**Don't optimize for task type splitting (infrastructure vs. coding).** Optimize for **context continuity and minimal friction.** The proposed workflow created artificial boundaries that would require the user to become a manual message bus between two AIs.

**Critical question answered**: "What can't Claude Code do that you need?" → No specific gap identified, making integration unjustified.

## Status: Closed

This investigation is complete. Google Antigravity exists and is a legitimate product, but integration with Claude Code infrastructure is not beneficial. If interest resurfaces in the future, start with Option 1 (evaluate it standalone for a complete project) rather than attempting integration.
