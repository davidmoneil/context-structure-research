# Session Notes: Agent Selection Pattern Integration

**Date**: 2026-01-01
**Focus**: Integrating newly installed Claude Code plugin agents into project design patterns
**Status**: Completed

---

## Summary

Created comprehensive documentation for choosing between the two types of agents available in Claude Code:
1. **Custom Agents** - Your specialized agents with persistent memory (`/agent`)
2. **Built-in Subagents** - Plugin-based agents invoked automatically via Task tool

## New Plugin Agents Documented

### Core Subagents (always available)
- `Explore` - Fast codebase exploration
- `Plan` - Software architect for implementation strategies
- `claude-code-guide` - Documentation lookup for Claude Code/Agent SDK

### feature-dev Plugin
- `feature-dev:code-architect` - Design feature architectures
- `feature-dev:code-explorer` - Analyze existing features
- `feature-dev:code-reviewer` - Review code with confidence filtering

### hookify Plugin
- `hookify:conversation-analyzer` - Find behaviors for hooks

### agent-sdk-dev Plugin
- `agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-py` - Verify Python SDK apps
- `agent-sdk-dev:agent-sdk-verifier-ts` - Verify TypeScript SDK apps

### project-plan-validator
- Validates project plans against infrastructure patterns

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `.claude/context/patterns/agent-selection-pattern.md` (NEW - 200+ lines)
  - Decision matrix for choosing automation approach
  - Built-in subagent reference tables
  - Custom agent reference
  - Decision flow diagram
  - PARC integration guidance

### Modified
- `.claude/context/patterns/_index.md` - Added new pattern entry
- `.claude/context/_index.md` - Updated Agent System section, Recent Updates
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Added:
  - Quick Links entry for agent-selection-pattern
  - Agent Selection to Core Workflow Patterns
  - New "Built-in Subagents" section
- `.claude/context/patterns/prompt-design-review.md` - Added:
  - Agent selection to Assess phase table
  - Agent Selection Quick Check
  - Related documentation link
- `.claude/context/systems/agent-system.md` - Added:
  - Built-in Subagents section
  - Comparison table (custom vs built-in)

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Agent Selection in PARC**: Added to Assess phase since choosing the right automation mechanism is part of design review

2. **Quick Check Format**: Added condensed decision guide:
   - Code/architecture work? → Built-in subagent
   - Recurring multi-step? → Custom agent
   - Quick repeatable? → Skill/slash command
   - Simple one-off? → Direct tools

3. **CLAUDE.md Organization**: Added Built-in Subagents as a new section after MCP Tools (since they're both tool-like capabilities)

## Pattern Integration Points

| Pattern | How Agent Selection Integrates |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| PARC | Added to Assess phase checklist |
| Memory Storage | Custom agents use memory, subagents don't |
| Workflow Patterns | Agents can implement workflow patterns |
| Model Selection | Subagents inherit model from session |

## Next Steps (if continuing this work)

- [ ] Consider creating a `/select-agent` slash command for explicit agent selection guidance
- [ ] Add agent selection considerations to agent roadmap
- [ ] Monitor usage to validate decision matrix accuracy
