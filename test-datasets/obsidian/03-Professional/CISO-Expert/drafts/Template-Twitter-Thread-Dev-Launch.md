# Twitter Thread Template: Dev Tool Launch

## Seven Hook Formulas (Pick One)

### 1. Contrarian Statement
Challenge a widely-held belief. Forces the reader to stop and argue.
> "Microservices solve everything" is wrong. Monoliths are winning in 2026.

### 2. Specific Number + Outcome
Concrete numbers signal you measured something, not just opined.
> I analyzed 847 breach postmortems. One pattern appeared in 73% of them:

### 3. "I Built" Confession
Personal building story with a turning point. The "Show HN" native format.
> 3 AM. My deployment crashed prod. What I discovered changed how I think about [X]:

### 4. Curiosity Gap
Name a specific pain your audience has, withhold the answer.
> Most pentesters miss this vulnerability class entirely.

### 5. Direct Address / "If You" Filter
Self-selecting filter. People who match feel personally called out.
> If you're running Kubernetes in production without this, read this first:

### 6. Timely / Breaking
Tie to a recent event, CVE, or industry shift.
> [Major vendor] just changed their licensing. Here's what it means for your stack:

### 7. Transformation Story
Before/after with a specific timeframe.
> From zero observability to catching incidents before users notice — in 3 weeks. Here's the exact setup:

## Thread Structure (7 Tweets)

### Tweet 1: THE HOOK
- Pattern interrupt. Bold claim, specific number, or "I built" confession.
- **No hashtags. No links. No @mentions.**
- Goal: Stop the scroll. Create an open loop.

### Tweet 2: THE PROBLEM (Pain Amplification)
- Name the specific pain. Be concrete.
- "Every time I needed to [X], I had to [painful manual process]."
- Quantify the pain: hours wasted, incidents caused.

### Tweet 3: THE SOLUTION + VISUAL
- One clear sentence: "So I built [tool name]: [one-line description]."
- Include a screenshot, GIF, or short demo clip.
- "It's open source."

### Tweet 4-5: THE PROOF (Technical Credibility)
- How it works, briefly. Architecture decisions.
- Talk like a fellow builder: "We chose [X] over [Y] because..."
- Code snippet, terminal output, or before/after comparison.

### Tweet 6: THE SURPRISE / SOCIAL PROOF
- Unexpected result, early user quote, or non-obvious benefit.
- "The thing I didn't expect..."
- Honest limitations build trust: "What it doesn't do (yet):"

### Tweet 7: THE CTA
- Clear, single ask + link.
- Double CTA works best: engagement ask + link.
- 1-2 hashtags allowed here only.

## Rules

1. **80% of effort on the hook.** If tweet 1 doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters.
2. **No links in early tweets.** X deprioritizes tweets with external links. Link only in final CTA.
3. **Escalate value.** Don't front-load. Save a genuine surprise for tweet 5-6.
4. **Open loops between tweets.** "But here's the thing..." or "That's not even the most interesting part."
5. **Vary tweet length.** Short punchy one-liner between two longer tweets.
6. **One CTA at the end.** Optimize for replies (75x algorithmic weight vs. likes).
7. **No hashtags except final tweet.** Hashtags signal "marketing" to dev audiences.
8. **Write like a builder, not a marketer.** "We're excited to announce" = death.
9. **No superlatives.** "The fastest," "the best" — dev audiences punish this.
10. **Stay in replies for the first hour.** Answer every question. This drives algorithmic momentum.

## Timing

- **Best day:** Wednesday
- **Best time:** 12-2 PM ET (EST/PT overlap)
- **Have allies ready** to engage in the first 15 minutes

## CTA Types (Choose Based on Goal)

| Goal | CTA Pattern |
|------|-------------|
| Reach | "Reply with your biggest [X] problem" (replies = 75x weight of likes) |
| Repo stars | "Star it if useful: [link]" |
| Blog traffic | "Full writeup: [link]" |
| Both | Double CTA: link + reply question |

## For Cybersecurity Audiences Specifically

- "No telemetry" and "no vendor lock-in" are high-signal trust phrases
- Honest limitation disclosure builds more credibility than superlatives
- Close with a practitioner knowledge-sharing question
- Tie to recent CVE/breach if timing allows
