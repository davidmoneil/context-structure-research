# Top 5 common blunders in your Incident Response Policy

With 10+ years of cyber security consulting for organizations across the industry, I have seen many incident response  ('IR') plans.  This includes enterprise-level 50-page incident response plans, all the way down to 2-3 page documents for small-medium businesses.  The following list of blunders is a compilation of the worst I have seen in incident response policies.  

I also go in-depth about "[Top 5 things for a Successful Cyber Response 'IR' Plan](https://cisoexpert.com/cyber-resilience/top-5-successful-incident-response-ir-plan/)". 

###  This is my list of the** top 5 things NOT to put in your Incident Response Policy** / **Plan**:  

- The most common mistakes I see in an incident response plan is its **attempt to be everything** to everyone.When authoring your document, clearly outline the audience of your document and how it should be used this will help ensure that it to the point and clear on what it covers.  (See item #2)

- Your IR Policy **should not pretend to be**: A detailed process or Pprocedures document or guide.  You might be tempted to add all the information about your IR process into a single document, combining the Policy, Standard, Process and Proceduers.  This   
- A Business Continuity Plan, 
- A Data Classification Standard,  
- A Breach Response Legal Guide, or

- **Should be updated** at least annually.  I have seen some outdated content by five to seven years
 
- I have seen where outsourcing the development leads to a templitized and **overly complex incident response** document (for the size, industry and capabilities of their IR response team). As stated above, in an attempt to be everything your plan can quickly turn into a series of 

- Good plan or not, if it lives on a shelf (**shelfware**) then it isn't helping anyone Train
- Review 
- Update 

The best incident response plans/policies are those documents that are usable, updated,d and reviewed on a consistent frequency.  All other issues tend to be removed if the document is practical for your team.  While some teams may need a complex document, others only need it to be a crisis-level incident response plan.  The goal should be 100% understood and used within your organization. 

If your incident response plan falls into the categories above.... my best recommendation is to start using it today and update it tomorrow (rinse and repeat) until you have an incident response plan that works for your business.
