# Navigating the Unknown: Effective Vendor Risk Questionnaires for Generative AI Technologies

This post will delve into the complexities of assessing vendors providing generative AI technologies, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). It will emphasize the criticality of understanding how vendors handle and utilize the data fed into these models. The introduction will set the stage by highlighting the importance of thorough vetting to ensure alignment with data privacy, security standards, and ethical use.

## Considerations 

Let's explore key considerations in drafting effective vendor risk questionnaires. There is a real need for transparency in data usage, compliance with data residency, and adherence to best practices in data handling. It will emphasize the potential risks and implications of data misuse or unethical AI practices.

## Top Questions to Ask 

**1. Data Utilization for Model training **

The post will delve into why it's crucial to understand if a vendor uses your data to train their own LLM models. It will discuss the implications for data privacy, intellectual property rights, and potential conflicts of interest. The question aims to ensure that the company's data isn't being used in ways that haven't been explicitly authorized.

**2. Cross-Customer Model Generation:**

This section will tackle the concern about whether vendors use prompt data to generate models that are not exclusively dedicated to your business. It will discuss the importance of having the option to opt out, ensuring that sensitive or proprietary data isn't inadvertently used in models that benefit other clients. This question seeks to safeguard against unintended data sharing and ensure that the vendor respects client-specific boundaries.

**3. Adherence to Data Residency and Access Standards:**

The post will explore the importance of vendors following common best practices for data residency and access requirements. Using the example of vector databases for customer content will underscore the need for compliance with regional data protection regulations and the security of data in transit and at rest. This question aims to confirm the vendor's commitment to data sovereignty and secure data handling practices.

## Conclusion 

The conclusion will reiterate the importance of thoroughly vetting generative AI vendors, emphasizing that understanding how vendors handle data is paramount to maintaining security, privacy, and ethical standards. The post will encourage readers to use these questions as a starting point for their own vendor assessments, adapting as necessary to fit their specific industry and regulatory requirements.

This expanded post idea aims to provide CISOs and other cybersecurity professionals with a practical, informative guide to evaluating the data handling practices of generative AI vendors, ensuring that their partnerships in the AI space are secure, ethical, and compliant.
