# A CISO's Guide to Conquering the complexity of SOAR in this lifetime

Many organizations struggle with even the idea of building out a Security Orchestration and Automated Response ('SOAR') strategy for a number of critical reasons.

- SOAR is often **considered a 'technology capability**' and not a strategy that integrates with the business and security functions. 
-  SOAR traditionally **focuses on the technical capability** of tool integration and analysis, but the automation of the user workstream.  When considered in this light, you can have better reporting on ROI. 
- Most SOAR platforms, **have a limited number of use-cases** that may or may **not be relevant to your organization**.  This lack of understanding around the value of a SOAR platform can make the initial purchase a daunting decision leaving you with purchasing paralysis. 

Additionally, common complaints from the Chief Information Security Officer's ('CISO')'s about SOAR include, but are not limited to, the following. 

- We have already spent $$$ on existing security tools, that have integrations, why do we need a SOAR platform? 
- SOAR is to complex
- We have too many resource constraints, and can't sacrifice and analyst for a developer
- SOAR is only an incident response tool, I need something that is going to more problems than just one of the hundreds I'm facing. 

Sorting thru the noise and hype & find true value in a SOAR takes experience, and sometimes an outside perspective. 

The CISO Expert approach
