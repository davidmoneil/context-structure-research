Their product portfolio is anchored by Positronic Companion Series (39% of revenue), which dominates the consumer robotics market with a 42% global share. The Industrial Automation Platform (35% of revenue) shows strong enterprise traction, while Neural Interface Modules (19%) represent their high-growth, high-margin innovation pipeline. The Synthetic Consciousness Engine (9%) serves as a strategic differentiator with high-margin enterprise and developer licensing.\\\\n\\\\nThe revenue mix suggests a deliberate strategy of balanced growth across consumer, enterprise, and specialized medical technology markets. With a total addressable market estimated at $376 billion by 2128 and current market share of 25%, Soong-Daystrom is well-positioned to capitalize on aging demographics, labor constraints, and increasing enterprise AI adoption.\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\", \\\"sources_used\\\": [\\\"/soong-daystrom/_source/financial/annual-report-2123.md\\\", \\\"/soong-daystrom/_source/financial/quarterly-report-q2-2124.md\\\", \\\"/soong-daystrom/_source/competitors/competitive-analysis.md\\\"]}\",\"session_id\":\"269b470f-7c50-4aaa-810b-d10e797fa7aa\",\"total_cost_usd\":0.1603679,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":10,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":6378,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":64174,\"output_tokens\":570,\"server_tool_use\":{\"web_search_requests\":0,\"web_fetch_requests\":0},\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":6378,\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":0}},\"modelUsage\":{\"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\":{\"inputTokens\":13832,\"outputTokens\":3083,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":127672,\"cacheCreationInputTokens\":52490,\"webSearchRequests\":0,\"costUSD\":0.10762669999999999,\"contextWindow\":200000,\"maxOutputTokens\":64000},\"claude-3-5-haiku-latest\":{\"inputTokens\":29,\"outputTokens\":2783,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":134775,\"cacheCreationInputTokens\":30804,\"webSearchRequests\":0,\"costUSD\":0.052741199999999995,\"contextWindow\":200000,\"maxOutputTokens\":8192}},\"permission_denials\":[],\"uuid\":\"b7538dcd-eeef-4ee8-86bf-f576d942aacf\"}",
