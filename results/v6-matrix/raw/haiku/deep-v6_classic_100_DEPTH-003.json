Their current $6.14B revenue is predominantly derived from enterprise automation (37.8% market share, $1.83B) and government/defense contracts (32.4% market share, $740M). However, the company recognizes critical growth opportunities in underserved segments like consumer robotics (56% growth potential, currently only 3.4% market share) and healthcare (42% growth potential, currently 8.9% market share). This suggests a strategic pivot from traditional enterprise and defense markets towards more dynamic, high-growth consumer and specialized technical markets.\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\", \\\"sources_used\\\": [\\\"/home/davidmoneil/Code/context-structure-research/soong-daystrom/deep-v6/market-intelligence/market-intelligence-doc-1.md\\\"]}\",\"session_id\":\"9cbf9f23-cdd8-4b36-9191-576c8d59532b\",\"total_cost_usd\":0.02472652,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":25,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":11772,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":111194,\"output_tokens\":889,\"server_tool_use\":{\"web_search_requests\":0,\"web_fetch_requests\":0},\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":11772,\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":0}},\"modelUsage\":{\"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\":{\"inputTokens\":143,\"outputTokens\":68,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":0,\"cacheCreationInputTokens\":0,\"webSearchRequests\":0,\"costUSD\":0.00048300000000000003,\"contextWindow\":200000,\"maxOutputTokens\":64000},\"claude-3-5-haiku-latest\":{\"inputTokens\":25,\"outputTokens\":889,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":111194,\"cacheCreationInputTokens\":11772,\"webSearchRequests\":0,\"costUSD\":0.024243519999999998,\"contextWindow\":200000,\"maxOutputTokens\":8192}},\"permission_denials\":[{\"tool_name\":\"WebSearch\",\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01Bgwi4V2tqpPpaZH3jniDo3\",\"tool_input\":{\"query\":\"Soong-Daystrom Industries ATLAS ARIA Nexus product revenue mix\"}},{\"tool_name\":\"Write\",\"tool_use_id\":\"toolu_01TDA1erqiHC6n2pdXffsTwp\",\"tool_input\":{\"file_path\":\"/tmp/soong_daystrom_revenue_analysis.json\",\"content\":\"{\\n  \\\"answer\\\": \\\"Soong-Daystrom Industries' revenue mix reveals a complex, enterprise-focused strategy with significant untapped potential in emerging markets.
