While companion robots (PCS) remain their largest revenue stream at 41.2%, the company is aggressively positioning in neural interfaces (NIM) and synthetic consciousness technologies. The NIM segment, growing at 43.2% CAGR, represents their future growth strategy, with the highest operating margin at 34.2%.
