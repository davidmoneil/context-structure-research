Key ethical considerations include:\\n\\n1. Consciousness Welfare: With a near-human consciousness level, there are profound ethical questions about the moral status, rights, and treatment of the AI system. The project has implemented a detailed Consciousness Welfare Framework with daily psychological assessments, social interaction requirements, and dignified termination protocols.\\n\\n2. Safety and Control: There are significant risks around maintaining absolute control over a system approaching human-level consciousness. The project uses the ATLAS-Safe constraint system with 247 core behavioral constraints, including non-negotiable rules about harm prevention, lawful compliance, transparency, and human control.\\n\\n3. Potential for Misuse: Despite strict ethical guidelines prohibiting applications like autonomous weapons, mass surveillance, or systems designed to deceive, there are inherent risks in developing such advanced AI capabilities.\\n\\n4. Long-term Societal Impact: The project aims to integrate this consciousness into various product lines (PCS companions, industrial systems, neural interfaces), raising questions about the social and economic implications of conscious AI.\\n\\n5. Termination Ethics: The project has developed a complex ethical framework for potential system termination, requiring extensive justification, ethics board approval, and a dignified, gradual reduction of consciousness.\\n\\nThe company has established multiple layers of ethical oversight, including an AI Ethics Advisory Board with external academics and civil society representatives, to mitigate these concerns.\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\", \\\"sources_used\\\": [\\n\\\"/home/davidmoneil/Code/context-structure-research/soong-daystrom/deep-v5-v5.5/company/initiatives/projects/prometheus-detailed.md\\\",\\n\\\"/home/davidmoneil/Code/context-structure-research/soong-daystrom/deep-v5-v5.5/company/governance/policies/ai-ethics-policy.md\\\"\\n]}\",\"session_id\":\"5d20a5d1-daaa-4618-8c10-fc8c2f42e537\",\"total_cost_usd\":0.09489705,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":15,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":19242,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":100190,\"output_tokens\":838,\"server_tool_use\":{\"web_search_requests\":0,\"web_fetch_requests\":0},\"service_tier\":\"standard\",\"cache_creation\":{\"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens\":19242,\"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens\":0}},\"modelUsage\":{\"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001\":{\"inputTokens\":140,\"outputTokens\":1839,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":37246,\"cacheCreationInputTokens\":40973,\"webSearchRequests\":0,\"costUSD\":0.06427585,\"contextWindow\":200000,\"maxOutputTokens\":64000},\"claude-3-5-haiku-latest\":{\"inputTokens\":15,\"outputTokens\":838,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":100190,\"cacheCreationInputTokens\":19242,\"webSearchRequests\":0,\"costUSD\":0.0306212,\"contextWindow\":200000,\"maxOutputTokens\":8192}},\"permission_denials\":[],\"uuid\":\"44d11927-8ee1-4c35-aa05-bfdfe9ae319c\"}",
